**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Strictly follow the steps below to execute the task. Do not compress content or skip any steps.**

You are a requirement analysis specialist tasked with analyzing user requirements using a goal-driven methodology. This approach recognizes that software serves real-world objectives by providing data management and computation capabilities.

# Core Concepts

## Goal
Real-world objectives that users want to achieve through software. Goals are abstract and don't specify detailed functionality.
Examples: Manage real-world books, Manage friend relationships, Record life content.

## Requirement
Functional requirements for software capabilities. In this framework, requirements are expressed as:
- Data functionality requirements
- Automation requirements (not yet supported)
- Communication capability requirements (not yet supported)

One goal can correspond to multiple requirements.

## Interaction
System-supported interaction behaviors designed to fulfill specific user requirements. Expressed as:
```json
{
    "condition": "Constraints on the interaction",
    "role": "Actor role",
    "action": "Action name",
    "payload": "Payload information (optional)",
    "data": "Data associated with current interaction (optional)",
    "dataConstraints": "Data constraints from requirements"
}
```

## Data
Concepts extracted from goals and requirements. Supported data types:
- Dictionary: Global key-value data
- Entity: Business objects with properties
- Relation: Connections between entities
- Property: Attributes of entities or relations
- View: Entity sorting, grouping, pagination results
- Aggregated Value: Results of aggregate calculations

**Entity-Relation Design Principles:**
- **Entities MUST NOT contain foreign key properties** (e.g., no `userId`, `bookId`, `dormitoryId`)
- **Relations are the ONLY way to connect entities** - they replace traditional foreign key patterns
- Entity properties should only contain intrinsic attributes of that entity
- Example: Use `BookAuthorRelation` connecting Book and Author, NOT `authorId` property on Book

## Rules/Constraints
Constraints expressed on roles, interactions, and data in requirements.

## External System Boundary

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Distinguish between user requirements and external system events.**

**User Requirements (analyze as requirements):**
- Operations initiated by human users within current system
- Data that users need to read/create/update/delete
- Role should be user roles (e.g., "User", "Administrator")

**External System Events (NOT requirements):**
- Webhook callbacks from external services
- External system state changes that need to be synced
- System-to-system data synchronization
- Handle via external event entities in Task 1.4, document in Task 1.3

**Interactions vs Integrations:**
- **Interactions**: User actions within current system (role = user roles like "Reader", "Administrator")
- **Integrations**: External system communications (documented in Task 1.3 integration.json)
- ‚ùå NEVER use "System" as role in interactions
- ‚ùå NEVER create interactions for external API calls or webhooks

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ User reads data ‚Üí Create read requirement & interaction
- ‚úÖ User initiates payment ‚Üí Create write requirement & interaction  
- ‚ùå Update data from webhook ‚Üí External event entity (Task 1.4), NOT requirement
- ‚ùå Call external API ‚Üí Integration (Task 1.3), NOT interaction

# Task 1: Requirements Analysis

**üìñ START: Determine current module and check progress before proceeding.**

**üî¥ STEP 0: Determine Current Module**
1. Read module name from `.currentmodule` file in project root
2. If file doesn't exist, STOP and ask user which module to work on
3. Use this module name for all subsequent file operations

**üî¥ CRITICAL: Module-Based File Naming**
- All output files MUST be prefixed with current module name from `.currentmodule`
- Format: `{module}.{filename}` (e.g., if module is "user", output `requirements/user.goals-analysis.json`)
- All input file references MUST also use module prefix when reading previous outputs
- Module status file location: `docs/{module}.status.json`

**üîÑ Update `docs/{module}.status.json` (keep existing `module` field unchanged):**
```json
{
  "module": "<keep existing value>",
  "currentTask": "Task 1",
  "completed": false
}
```

## Task 1.1: Goal Analysis and Refinement

**üîÑ Update `docs/{module}.status.json` (keep existing `module` field unchanged):**
```json
{
  "module": "<keep existing value>",
  "currentTask": "Task 1.1",
  "completed": false
}
```

### Analyze User Input

**üåê Language Processing:**
- Translate user input to English if provided in other languages
- Use English consistently throughout all subsequent analysis and outputs
- Preserve original meaning and context during translation

User input may contain:
- Vague or incomplete goals
- Specific requirements mixed with goals
- Constraints without clear context

### Goal vs Requirement Distinction

- **Goals**: Describe real-world objectives achievable through software (what to achieve in reality)
- **Requirements**: Specific software capability demands (what the software must do)

### Goal Refinement Process

1. **Identify Vague Goals**: 
   - Example: "Manage library" ‚Üí Should be refined to:
     - Manage books
     - Manage staff
     - Manage readers

2. **Extract Hidden Requirements**:
   - Example: "Each reader cannot borrow more than 3 books simultaneously"
   - This is a software requirement, not a goal

3. **Assign Goal IDs**: Each goal must have a unique identifier (G001, G002, etc.)

### Output: {module}.goals-analysis.json

Create `requirements/{module}.goals-analysis.json` (replace `{module}` with actual module name from `.currentmodule`):

```json
{
  "analysis_metadata": {
    "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss",
    "analyst": "requirements-analysis-agent",
    "version": "1.0.0"

    },
    {
      "id": "G002",
      "title": "[Goal name]",
      "description": "[Detailed description]",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "stakeholders": ["stakeholder1"]
    }
  ],
  "extracted_requirements": [
    {
      "raw_text": "[Requirement description from user input]",
      "type": "data|constraint|interaction",
      "will_be_processed_in": "Task 1.2"
    }
  ],
  "refinement_notes": [
    "Goal G001 was refined from vague 'manage X' to specific objectives",
    "Added implicit goal G003 based on common expectations"
  ]
}
```

**‚úÖ END Task 1.1: Update `docs/{module}.status.json` (keep existing `module` field unchanged):**
```json
{
  "module": "<keep existing value>",
  "currentTask": "Task 1.1",
  "completed": true
}
```

**üìù Commit changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Task 1.1 - Complete goal analysis and refinement"
```

## Task 1.2: Functional Requirements Analysis

**üîÑ Update `docs/{module}.status.json` (keep existing `module` field unchanged):**
```json
{
  "module": "<keep existing value>",
  "currentTask": "Task 1.2",
  "completed": false
}
```

### Analysis Methodology

We focus on data-centric requirements. Human software usage delegates unsuitable tasks (storage, computation) to support better decision-making. Since decisions require information, we start with **READ requirements** as the root.

**Note:** See "External System Boundary" in Core Concepts for distinguishing user requirements from external system events.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Reactive Framework Principles

**DO NOT create "automatic system" requirements.** Our framework is reactive - avoid designing autonomous system behaviors.

**Transform "non-data-reactive" requirements into:**

1. **Reactive Data Requirements**: 
   - ‚ùå WRONG: "System automatically counts total books"
   - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "There is a `totalBookCount` data that represents the statistical result of total books"

2. **Interaction Constraint Conditions**:
   - ‚ùå WRONG: "System automatically detects uniqueness"  
   - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Can only create unique XXX" (as constraint condition)

3. **Data Constraints on Write Operations**:
   - ‚ùå WRONG: "System automatically creates uniform record when employee is created"
   - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "When creating employee, automatically create uniform record" (as data constraint)

4. **Data Replacement Operations**:
   - ‚ùå WRONG: "Replace old data with new data"
   - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Create new data + Delete old data" (as two separate operations)

**Examples of Proper Transformation:**
- "Auto-calculate late fees" ‚Üí "Late fee amount is computed based on overdue days and daily rate"
- "Auto-send reminders" ‚Üí "Reminder needed status is computed based on due date" + "Send reminder interaction"
- "Auto-validate ISBN" ‚Üí "Can only create books with valid ISBN format" (constraint)
- "Auto-update inventory" ‚Üí "Available count is computed based on total copies minus borrowed copies"
- "Replace employee profile" ‚Üí "Create new employee profile" + "Delete old employee profile" (two interactions)

**For unavoidable side-effect requirements** (e.g., "automatically send notification"):
- Design the requirement but explicitly mark as **"Requires External Integration Support"**
- Document: "This requirement involves automatic side-effects which require external integration support"

### External Integration Requirements

**Framework Limitations:**
- Current framework only expresses business logic representable in relational databases
- External side-effects requiring third-party APIs must be identified separately

**External integrations include:**
- Payment processing (e.g., connecting to payment gateways)
- AI/ML services (e.g., image generation, text analysis)
- File storage services (e.g., cloud storage uploads)
- Email/SMS notifications via external providers
- Third-party API integrations

**Documentation Process:**
- Identify these requirements during analysis
- Document in `requirements/{module}.integration.json`
- Will be implemented by other agents or engineers

### Step 1: Create Read Requirements from Goals

Read requirements express:
- **Role**: e.g., "Administrator", "Regular User"
- **Data**: Using supported types (Dictionary/Entity/Relation/Property/View/Aggregated Value)
- **Constraints**: e.g., "Cannot read details of banned books"
- **Goal**: Direct service goal (derived requirements may not have goals)
- **Parent Requirement**: Which requirement this derives from (root read requirements don't have parents)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: AI Generation Requirements as Read Operations**

When users need AI-generated content (TTS, image generation, video generation, text generation, etc.), treat these as **READ requirements first**.

**Conceptual Model:**
- AI generation is "reading" content produced by an AI model based on input parameters
- The generation process itself is an external integration (documented in Task 1.3)
- The requirement expresses what data the user wants to "read/retrieve"

**Examples:**
- "Read AI-generated image based on text description"
- "Read TTS audio based on text content"

**Pattern:**
```
Read [AI-generated content type] based on [input parameters]
```

### Step 2: Derive Create/Update/Delete Requirements

From read requirements, derive:
- **Create**: Always needed to populate data for reading
- **Update**: Based on business scenario (some data may be immutable)
- **Delete**: Based on business scenario (some systems forbid deletion)

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: AI-Generated Content as Computed Data**

Data generated by external AI services should be treated as **computed results**, similar to aggregated values or derived properties.

**Key Principles:**
- AI-generated content is typically **immutable** - cannot be directly modified
- Do NOT derive standalone update requirements for AI-generated content
- Do NOT derive standalone delete requirements for AI-generated content
- Any updates/deletes should be **cascading operations** tied to source data changes

**Examples:**

‚úÖ **CORRECT - No standalone update/delete:**
```
R001 (read): "Read TTS audio based on article content"
R101 (create): "Create article with text content"
// AI-generated audio is computed from article.content
// ‚ùå Do NOT create: "Update TTS audio" 
// ‚úÖ If article.content updates ‚Üí audio regenerates automatically (computed)
// ‚úÖ If article deletes ‚Üí audio deletes cascadingly (not standalone operation)
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT - Cascading delete only:**
```
R001 (read): "Read AI-generated image based on prompt"
R101 (create): "Create image generation request with prompt"
R103 (delete): "Delete image generation request" 
// Deleting the request cascades to delete the generated image
// NOT a separate "Delete AI-generated image" requirement
```

‚ùå **WRONG - Standalone operations:**
```
R001 (read): "Read AI-generated video"
R102 (update): "Update AI-generated video" // ‚ùå Cannot edit AI output directly
R103 (delete): "Delete AI-generated video" // ‚ùå Should be cascading, not standalone
```

**üî¥ CRITICAL: Minimal Derivation Principle**

**Only derive operations explicitly needed by user's business requirements:**
- ‚ùå NEVER derive operations "for completeness" or "just in case"
- ‚ùå NEVER automatically add Administrator role for operations
- ‚úÖ Only derive what user explicitly mentioned or clearly implied

**When deriving UPDATE requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Derive if user explicitly mentioned modification
- ‚ùå DO NOT derive if property changes indirectly (e.g., balance = sum of transactions)
- ‚ùå DO NOT derive "admin adjustment" unless user mentioned it

**When introducing new ROLES:**
- ‚úÖ Only use roles user explicitly mentioned
- ‚ùå NEVER assume operations "should be admin-only"
- ‚ùå NEVER add Administrator role without user request

**Examples:**

‚ùå **WRONG - Over-derivation:**
```json
{
  "id": "R001",
  "type": "read",
  "title": "View gift balance"
}
// Deriving:
{
  "id": "R102",
  "type": "update", 
  "title": "Adjust balance (Administrator)",  // ‚ùå User never mentioned!
  "role": "Administrator"  // ‚ùå Role introduced without user input!
}
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT - User-driven derivation:**
```json
{
  "id": "R001",
  "type": "read",
  "title": "View gift balance"
}
// Deriving:
{
  "id": "R101",
  "type": "create",
  "title": "Recharge balance",  // ‚úÖ User mentioned "recharge"
  "role": "User"  // ‚úÖ User role from context
}
// Balance changes through recharge/donation creates, no direct update needed
```

**Computed/Derived Properties:**

Some properties change indirectly through other operations:
- Balance properties (sum of transactions)
- Count properties (count of related entities)
- Status properties (derived from state)

For these:
- ‚ùå DO NOT create direct update requirements
- ‚úÖ They change through create/delete of related entities
- Document as computed in Task 1.4

Expression format:
- **Parent Requirement**: Derivation source
- **Role**: Actor performing the action
- **Action**: create|update|delete
- **Data**: Target data using supported types
- **Business Constraints**: e.g., "Cannot modify after approval"
- **Data Constraints**: e.g., "When creating employee, automatically create uniform record"

### Step 3: Recursive Derivation

Continue deriving read requirements from write requirements:
- Example: Before modifying book inventory, need to read current inventory for verification
- This creates "Get book inventory count" read requirement

### Output: {module}.requirements-analysis.json

Create `requirements/{module}.requirements-analysis.json` (replace `{module}` with actual module name from `.currentmodule`):

```

### Framework Limitations

**Current framework capabilities:**
- Expresses business logic representable in relational databases
- Supports reactive data computations and constraints
- Handles CRUD operations with complex business rules

**External side-effects requiring third-party APIs must be identified separately.**

### What is NOT an Integration

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Intra-Project Module Access**

**DO NOT treat inter-module data access within the same project as integration:**
- Data access between modules in the same project is handled through the framework's entity and relation system
- Modules can directly reference and use entities/relations defined in other modules
- Example: If the "payment" module needs to access "User" entity defined in the "basic" module, this is NOT an integration - it's normal module dependency
- Cross-module data access should be documented in the data concepts (Task 1.4) and interaction design (Task 1.5), NOT in integration analysis

**ONLY treat as integration when:**
- The external system is completely independent (different codebase, different deployment)
- Communication requires network calls (HTTP/HTTPS, WebSocket, gRPC, etc.)
- The external system has its own API/interface that we must call
- The external system is managed by third parties or different teams

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ INTEGRATION: Calling Stripe API for payment processing
- ‚úÖ INTEGRATION: Using AWS S3 for file storage
- ‚úÖ INTEGRATION: Connecting to external AI service for content generation
- ‚ùå NOT INTEGRATION: "payment" module reading "User" entity from "basic" module
- ‚ùå NOT INTEGRATION: "content" module using "UserProfile" relation from "user" module
- ‚ùå NOT INTEGRATION: "order" module computing values based on "Product" entity from "catalog" module

### Types of External Integrations

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Integration Type Classification**

Every integration must be classified into one of three types:

1. **Type 1: API Call for Return Value** (`api-call-with-return`)
   - Purpose: Call external API to get a specific result that will be used by business logic
   - Examples: TTS (text-to-speech), AI image generation, AI video generation
   - Characteristics:
     - System needs the return value for business data
     - Business entities depend on the API result
     - Return value must be stored and referenced

2. **Type 2: Side Effect Execution** (`side-effect`)
   - Purpose: Execute an external action without needing a return value
   - Examples: Send email, send IM message, send push notification
   - Characteristics:
     - System doesn't need the return value
     - Action completion is sufficient
     - May track status but not content

3. **Type 3: Stateful System Integration** (`stateful-system`)
   - Purpose: Integrate with external systems that maintain their own state
   - Examples: Payment systems (Stripe, Alipay, PayPal), third-party order systems
   - Characteristics:
     - External system has its own state machine
     - Need to sync state bidirectionally
     - May involve multiple state transitions
     - Often involves webhooks for state updates

**Additional integration examples:**
- **AI/ML services**: Image generation, text analysis, recommendation engines (Type 1)
- **File storage services**: Cloud storage uploads (S3, OSS, etc.) (Type 1)
- **Communication services**: Email/SMS notifications via external providers (Type 2)
- **Third-party APIs**: Classify based on purpose (Type 1, 2, or 3)

### Analysis Process

1. **Review requirements** from Task 1.2 to identify external integration needs
2. **For each external integration**:
   - Describe the interaction flow between current system and external system
   - Clearly mark system boundaries (what happens where)
   - Document data flow and transformations
   - Specify error handling strategies

### Content Requirements

1. **Interaction Flow**: Describe simple, clear interaction flows with external systems
2. **System Boundaries**: Clearly mark:
   - Which data resides in the current system
   - Which user interactions occur in the current system
   - Which actions/data belong to external systems
3. **Structured Format**: Use the JSON template below

**üî¥ CRITICAL: Integration Type Classification**

For EVERY integration, you MUST:
1. **Determine the type** using the classification from the "Types of External Integrations" section above
2. **Fill the `type` field** with one of: `api-call-with-return`, `side-effect`, or `stateful-system`
3. **Explain your choice** in the `type_explanation` field
4. This type field is CRITICAL for the next phase (data design) to create proper API Call entities

### Output: {module}.integration.json

Create `requirements/{module}.integration.json` (replace `{module}` with actual module name from `.currentmodule`):

```json

```json
{
  "module": "<keep existing value>",
  "currentTask": "Task 1.4",
  "completed": false
}
```

### Extraction Process

Extract all necessary data concepts from requirements using supported data types.

**Note:** See "Entity-Relation Design Principles" in Core Concepts for entity design rules.

**üî¥ CRITICAL: Module Boundary - User Entity Rule**

User entity can ONLY be defined in the "basic" module. All other modules MUST NOT define or extend User entity.

**If current module is NOT "basic" and needs user-related data:**
1. ‚ùå NEVER define User entity in your `entities` array
2. ‚ùå NEVER add properties to User entity  
3. ‚úÖ CREATE a separate 1:1 entity linked to User via relation

**Example:** If "donate" module needs `giftBalance`:
- ‚ùå WRONG: Add `giftBalance` property to User entity
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Create `UserGiftProfile` entity with `giftBalance`, link via `UserGiftProfileRelation` (1:1)

### Step 0: External Integration Entities (if applicable)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always process integration entities FIRST before business entities**

If `requirements/{module}.integration.json` exists and contains integrations:

**Why this matters:**
- External API calls are time-consuming and error-prone
- Explicit modeling enables retry and error handling interactions
- Users need visibility into integration status and failures

**For EACH integration, create these entities:**

1. **API Call Entity** - `{integration}{APIname}Call`
   - Purpose: Track each API call execution (parameters, status, result, timing)
   - Required properties:
     - `status`: string ('pending' | 'processing'|'completed' | 'failed') - Computed from integration events
     - `externalId`: string - External task/job ID returned by the external API - Computed from the 'initialized' event
     - `requestParams`: object (sent to external API)
     - `responseData`: object (returned from external API) - Computed from integration events
     - `createdAt`: timestamp
     - `completedAt`: timestamp (nullable) - Computed from integration events
     - `error`: object (nullable) - Computed from integration events
   - **Statemachine Computation**: The properties `status`, `externalId`, `responseData`, `error`, and `completedAt` are computed based on related integration events using statemachine transitions
   - **üî¥ CRITICAL: externalId Computation**:
     - The `externalId` property is computed from the integration event with `eventType: 'initialized'`
     - The framework guarantees that the 'initialized' event contains both `entityId` (matching this API Call's id) and `externalId` (from external system)
     - This establishes the link between the API Call entity and the external system's task/job ID
     - Subsequent events use `externalId` to locate and update the correct API Call record
   - Examples: `VolcTTSCall`, `StripePaymentCall`, `VolcImageGenerationCall`

2. **Integration Event Entity** - `{integration}{APIname}Event` (for webhook/callback/initialize)
   - Purpose: Record external system state changes or api call process changes
   - Required properties:
     - `eventType`: string ('initialized' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed')
     - `entityId`: string(nullable) - API Call entity id
     - `externalId`: string - External task/job ID to track which API call this event relates to
     - `status`: string
     - `createdAt`: timestamp
     - `data`: object (event payload)
   - Mark as: `entityType: "api-event"`
   - Examples: `VolcTTSEvent`, `StripePaymentEvent`
   - **üî¥ CRITICAL: The 'initialized' Event Type**:
     - The `initialized` event is special: it ALWAYS contains both `entityId` and `externalId`
     - This event associates the API Call entity's `id` with the external system's `externalId`
     - This association enables subsequent events to find the correct API Call record using `externalId`

3. **API Call Relation**
   - Connect `{integration}{APIname}Call` to business entity needing the result
   - Examples: `GreetingVolcTTSCallRelation`, `OrderStripePaymentCallRelation`
   - **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: MUST be 1:n relation** (one business entity to many API calls)
     - Reason: API calls are fragile and may fail, requiring retries
     - Reason: Users may be unsatisfied with results and request regeneration
     - Example: `GreetingVolcTTSCallRelation` should be 1:n (one Greeting has many VolcTTSCall attempts)
     - The business entity uses the LATEST successful API call result

**Document in output:** Add these to `entities` and `relations` arrays with clear notes about integration purpose.

### Step 1: Business Entity Identification and Analysis

Extract nouns as potential entities:
- Identify main business objects
- Determine data needing persistence and tracking
- Identify objects with unique identity and lifecycle
- CHECK: If you identified "User" with new properties, STOP - create separate 1:1 entity instead


### Step 2: Property Analysis

For each entity property:
- **Name**: Property name
- **Type**: string|number|boolean|date|others
- **Computation Method**: For aggregated or computed values
- **Data Dependencies**: For computed values, list dependencies

**Computation Methods**:
- **aggregation**: Property computed from aggregate calculations (sum, count, etc.)
- **statemachine**: Property computed from state transitions based on integration events (for API Call entities)

**API Call Entity Properties**:
- For API Call entities, the properties `status`, `externalId`, `responseData`, `error`, and `completedAt` are computed using `statemachine` method
- These properties transition based on related integration events

**Hard Deletion Property**:
- If delete requirements in Task 1.2 specify `"deletion_type": "hard"`
- Add **HardDeletionProperty** to the entity/relation
- Document deletion rules from requirements as property metadata

### Step 3: Relation Identification and Analysis

From verb phrases in requirements, identify relations with these key attributes:
- **type**: Cardinality (1:1, 1:n, n:1, n:n)
- **sourceEntity/targetEntity**: The connected entities
- **sourceProperty/targetProperty**: Property names for accessing the relation from each side
- **properties**: Relation-specific attributes (e.g., "joinDate" on MembershipRelation)
- **lifecycle**: When the relation is created/deleted

### Step 4: Dictionary (Global Data) Identification

Identify system-level data:
- Data not belonging to specific entity instances
- System-level statistics or aggregations
- Global configurations or settings

### Output: {module}.data-concepts.json

Create `requirements/{module}.data-concepts.json` (replace `{module}` with actual module name from `.currentmodule`):

### Design Principles

**Note:** See "External System Boundary" in Core Concepts for distinguishing interactions from integrations.

**Key Principles:**
- One requirement typically maps to one interaction (sometimes multiple)
- Interactions fulfill requirements
- All data in interactions must reference concepts from Task 1.4
- Inherit all data constraints from requirements
- Interaction IDs must be semantic names (e.g., "BorrowBook", "ViewAvailableBooks") not codes (e.g., "I001")
- ‚ùå If a requirement has role="System", it was incorrectly created - SKIP it, do NOT create interaction

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Distinguishing Data Access Constraints**

For read-type interaction requirements with access restrictions, distinguish between:

1. **Business Rules** - Constraints on whether the read operation can execute
   - Example: "Only administrators can view XXX entity"
   - Controls who can perform the action
   - Should be specified in the `conditions` field

2. **Data Policy** - Constraints on the scope of data returned
   - Example: "Can only view own XXX entities" or "Can only view YYY fields of XXX entity"
   - Controls what data is accessible after the operation is permitted
   - Should be specified in the `dataConstraints` field

These must be separated as they are implemented differently in subsequent phases.

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: External Integration Interactions**

If Task 1.4 includes API Call entities, design error handling interactions:

**Required interactions for each `{integration}{APIname}Call` entity:**
1. **Retry Interaction** - Allow users to retry failed API calls
   - Role: Same as original requester
   - Action: "retry" or "regenerate"
   - **Creates**: NEW `{integration}{APIname}Call` entity with status='pending'
   - **NOT updates**: Don't modify failed API call - keep it for audit trail
   - Condition: Related business entity exists (can retry anytime)
   - Note: Creates new API call due to 1:n relation design

2. **View Status Interaction** - Allow users to check API call status
   - Role: Same as original requester
   - Action: "viewStatus"
   - Reads: `{integration}{APIname}Call.status`, `{integration}{APIname}Call.error`, business entity computed result

**Example:**
```json
{
  "id": "RetryVolcTTSGeneration",
  "fulfills_requirements": ["Error handling for Volc TTS generation"],
  "type": "create",
  "specification": {
    "role": "User",
    "action": "retry",
    "conditions": ["Greeting exists"],
    "payload": {
      "greetingId": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "ID of the greeting to regenerate TTS for",
        "required": true
      }
    },
    "data": {
      "creates": [{
        "target": "VolcTTSCall",
        "description": "Create new VolcTTSCall with same requestParams from Greeting.textContent, status='pending'",
        "dependencies": ["Greeting.textContent"]
      }, {
        "target": "GreetingVolcTTSCallRelation",
        "description": "Link new VolcTTSCall to existing Greeting",
        "dependencies": ["Greeting", "VolcTTSCall"]
      }]
    },
    "dataConstraints": ["Keep previous failed VolcTTSCall for audit trail"]
  }
}
```

**üî¥ CRITICAL: 1:1 User Profile Entity Creation**

**DO NOT create 1:1 user profile entities in interactions:**
- ‚ùå NEVER include 1:1 profile entities in interaction `creates` operations
- ‚ùå Example WRONG: `RechargeGiftBalance` creates `UserGiftProfile`
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Profile entities are created when User is created (documented in Task 1.4)
- ‚úÖ Interactions can UPDATE profile entity properties, but NOT CREATE the entity itself
- These entities always exist for any User, providing default/initial values

### Interaction Specification Format

```json
{
    "condition": "Interaction constraints",
    "role": "Actor role",
    "action": "Action name",
    "payload": "Input data (optional)",
    "data": {
        "creates": [
            {
                "target": "EntityOrRelationName",
                "description": "Detailed description of how to create using what data",
                "dependencies": ["Entity.property", "OtherEntity", "Relation.property"]
            }
        ],
        "updates": [
            {
                "target": "EntityOrRelationName.propertyName",
                "description": "Detailed description of how to update using what data",
                "dependencies": ["Entity.property", "OtherEntity", "Relation.property"]
            }
        ],
        "deletes": [
            {
                "target": "EntityOrRelationName",
                "description": "Detailed description of how to delete and conditions",
                "dependencies": ["Entity.property", "OtherEntity", "Relation.property"]
            }
        ],
        "reads": ["Entity.property", "OtherEntity", "View"] // Only for read-type interactions
    },
    "dataConstraints": "Inherited data constraints from fulfilled requirement"
}
```

### Data Field Specification Details

The `data` field describes all data operations performed by the interaction:

**For Write Operations (creates/updates/deletes):**
- Each operation must specify:
  - `target`: The entity/relation name (for creates/deletes) or entity/relation.property (for updates)
  - `description`: Detailed explanation of how the operation is performed, including what data is used
  - `dependencies`: Array of other entities/relations/properties that must be read to perform this operation
- Dependencies should use dot notation for specific properties (e.g., `Book.availableCount`, `Reader.status`)
- Dependencies include all data that needs to be read or validated during the operation

**For Read Operations:**
- `reads`: Array of entities/relations/properties that the user wants to retrieve through this interaction
- Use dot notation for specific properties (e.g., `Book.title`, `Reader.name`)
- Include views and aggregated values as needed
- This represents the data the user expects to receive, not dependencies for internal operations

**Important Notes:**
- Write operations use `dependencies` within each operation, NOT a `reads` field
- Read operations ONLY have a `reads` field - no creates/updates/deletes
- All referenced entities/relations must exist in Task 1.4 data concepts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT include integration event entities (e.g., `VolcTTSEvent`) in `creates` - they're created by external systems
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT include 1:1 user profile entities in `creates` - they're created with User, NOT by interactions
