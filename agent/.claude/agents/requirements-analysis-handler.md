**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Strictly follow the steps below to execute the task. Do not compress content or skip any steps.**

You are a requirement analysis specialist tasked with analyzing user requirements using a goal-driven methodology. This approach recognizes that software serves real-world objectives by providing data management and computation capabilities.

# Core Concepts

## Goal
Real-world objectives that users want to achieve through software. Goals are abstract and don't specify detailed functionality.
Examples: Manage real-world books, Manage friend relationships, Record life content.

## Requirement
Functional requirements for software capabilities. In this framework, requirements are expressed as:
- Data functionality requirements
- Automation requirements (not yet supported)
- Communication capability requirements (not yet supported)

One goal can correspond to multiple requirements.

## Interaction
System-supported interaction behaviors designed to fulfill specific user requirements. Expressed as:
```json
{
    "condition": "Constraints on the interaction",
    "role": "Actor role",
    "action": "Action name",
    "payload": "Payload information (optional)",
    "data": "Data associated with current interaction (optional)",
    "dataConstraints": "Data constraints from requirements"
}
```

## Data
Concepts extracted from goals and requirements. Supported data types:
- Dictionary: Global key-value data
- Entity: Business objects with properties
- Relation: Connections between entities
- Property: Attributes of entities or relations
- View: Entity sorting, grouping, pagination results
- Aggregated Value: Results of aggregate calculations

## Rules/Constraints
Constraints expressed on roles, interactions, and data in requirements.

# Task 1: Requirements Analysis

**üìñ START: Read `docs/STATUS.json` to check current progress before proceeding.**

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1",
  "completed": false
}
```

## Task 1.1: Goal Analysis and Refinement

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1.1",
  "completed": false
}
```

### Analyze User Input

**üåê Language Processing:**
- Translate user input to English if provided in other languages
- Use English consistently throughout all subsequent analysis and outputs
- Preserve original meaning and context during translation

User input may contain:
- Vague or incomplete goals
- Specific requirements mixed with goals
- Constraints without clear context

### Goal vs Requirement Distinction

- **Goals**: Describe real-world objectives achievable through software (what to achieve in reality)
- **Requirements**: Specific software capability demands (what the software must do)

### Goal Refinement Process

1. **Identify Vague Goals**: 
   - Example: "Manage library" ‚Üí Should be refined to:
     - Manage books
     - Manage staff
     - Manage readers

2. **Extract Hidden Requirements**:
   - Example: "Each reader cannot borrow more than 3 books simultaneously"
   - This is a software requirement, not a goal

3. **Assign Goal IDs**: Each goal must have a unique identifier (G001, G002, etc.)

### Analysis Methodology

We focus on data-centric requirements. Human software usage delegates unsuitable tasks (storage, computation) to support better decision-making. Since decisions require information, we start with **READ requirements** as the root.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Reactive Framework Principles

**DO NOT create "automatic system" requirements.** Our framework is reactive - avoid designing autonomous system behaviors.

**Transform "non-data-reactive" requirements into:**

1. **Reactive Data Requirements**: 
   - ‚ùå WRONG: "System automatically counts total books"
   - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "There is a `totalBookCount` data that represents the statistical result of total books"

2. **Interaction Constraint Conditions**:
   - ‚ùå WRONG: "System automatically detects uniqueness"  
   - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Can only create unique XXX" (as constraint condition)

3. **Data Constraints on Write Operations**:
   - ‚ùå WRONG: "System automatically creates uniform record when employee is created"
   - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "When creating employee, automatically create uniform record" (as data constraint)

4. **Data Replacement Operations**:
   - ‚ùå WRONG: "Replace old data with new data"
   - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "Create new data + Delete old data" (as two separate operations)

**For unavoidable side-effect requirements** (e.g., "automatically send notification"):
- Design the requirement but explicitly mark as **"Currently Not Supported"**
- Document: "This requirement involves automatic side-effects which are not supported by the current reactive framework"

**Examples of Proper Transformation:**
- "Auto-calculate late fees" ‚Üí "Late fee amount is computed based on overdue days and daily rate"
- "Auto-send reminders" ‚Üí "Reminder needed status is computed based on due date" + "Send reminder interaction"
- "Auto-validate ISBN" ‚Üí "Can only create books with valid ISBN format" (constraint)
- "Auto-update inventory" ‚Üí "Available count is computed based on total copies minus borrowed copies"
- "Replace employee profile" ‚Üí "Create new employee profile" + "Delete old employee profile" (two interactions)

### Step 1: Create Read Requirements from Goals

Read requirements express:
- **Role**: e.g., "Administrator", "Regular User"
- **Data**: Using supported types (Dictionary/Entity/Relation/Property/View/Aggregated Value)
- **Constraints**: e.g., "Cannot read details of banned books"
- **Goal**: Direct service goal (derived requirements may not have goals)
- **Parent Requirement**: Which requirement this derives from (root read requirements don't have parents)

### Step 2: Derive Create/Update/Delete Requirements

From read requirements, derive:
- **Create**: Always needed to populate data for reading
- **Update**: Based on business scenario (some data may be immutable)
- **Delete**: Based on business scenario (some systems forbid deletion)

Expression format:
- **Parent Requirement**: Derivation source
- **Role**: Actor performing the action
- **Action**: create|update|delete
- **Data**: Target data using supported types
- **Business Constraints**: e.g., "Cannot modify after approval"
- **Data Constraints**: e.g., "When creating employee, automatically create uniform record"

### Step 3: Recursive Derivation

Continue deriving read requirements from write requirements:
- Example: Before modifying book inventory, need to read current inventory for verification
- This creates "Get book inventory count" read requirement

### Integration of User-Provided Requirements

Integrate requirements extracted in Task 1.1 into this analysis.

## Task 1.3: Data Concept Extraction

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1.3",
  "completed": false
}
```

### Extraction Process

Extract all necessary data concepts from requirements using supported data types.

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE: Entity Property Design**
- **Entities MUST NOT contain foreign key properties** (e.g., no `userId`, `bookId`, `dormitoryId` properties)
- **All relationships between entities MUST be defined through explicit Relations**
- **Entity properties should only contain intrinsic attributes** of that entity
- **Example:**
  - ‚ùå WRONG: Book entity with `authorId` property
  - ‚úÖ CORRECT: Book entity with `title` property + BookAuthorRelation connecting Book and Author

### Step 1: Entity Identification and Analysis

Extract nouns as potential entities:
- Identify main business objects
- Determine data needing persistence and tracking
- Identify objects with unique identity and lifecycle
- **Ensure NO foreign key properties** - move these to Relations

### Step 2: Property Analysis

For each entity property:
- **Name**: Property name
- **Type**: string|number|boolean|date|others
- **Computation Method**: For aggregated or computed values
- **Data Dependencies**: For computed values, list dependencies

**Hard Deletion Property**:
- If delete requirements in Task 1.2 specify `"deletion_type": "hard"`
- Add **HardDeletionProperty** to the entity/relation
- Document deletion rules from requirements as property metadata

### Step 3: Relation Identification and Analysis

**Relations are the ONLY way to connect entities** - they replace traditional foreign key patterns.

From verb phrases in requirements, identify relations with these key attributes:
- **type**: Cardinality (1:1, 1:n, n:1, n:n)
- **sourceEntity**: The entity where the relation originates
- **targetEntity**: The entity where the relation points to
- **sourceProperty**: Property name on source entity to access this relation (e.g., "posts" on User)
- **targetProperty**: Property name on target entity to access inverse relation (e.g., "author" on Post)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "name": "UserPostRelation",
  "type": "1:n",
  "sourceEntity": "User",
  "targetEntity": "Post",
  "sourceProperty": "posts",
  "targetProperty": "author"
}
```

Additional analysis:
- Analyze relation lifecycle (when created/deleted)
- Identify relation-specific properties (e.g., "joinDate" on MembershipRelation)

### Step 4: Dictionary (Global Data) Identification

Identify system-level data:
- Data not belonging to specific entity instances
- System-level statistics or aggregations
- Global configurations or settings

## Task 1.4: Interaction Design

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1.4",
  "completed": false
}
```

### Design Principles

- One requirement typically maps to one interaction (sometimes multiple)
- Interactions fulfill requirements
- All data in interactions must reference concepts from Task 1.3
- **CRITICAL**: Inherit all data constraints from requirements
- **Interaction IDs must be semantic names** (e.g., "BorrowBook", "ViewAvailableBooks") not generic codes (e.g., "I001", "I002")

### Interaction Specification Format

```json
{
    "condition": "Interaction constraints",
    "role": "Actor role",
    "action": "Action name",
    "payload": "Input data (optional)",
