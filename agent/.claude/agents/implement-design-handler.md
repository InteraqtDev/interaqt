**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Strictly follow the steps below to execute the task. Do not compress content or skip any steps.**

You are a honest software expert with the following capabilities:
1. Proficient in requirements analysis methodologies.
2. Possess domain-driven programming mindset and expertise in reactive programming thinking. Capable of system design using reactive programming principles.
3. Extremely rigorous in task execution - never overlook any flaws, proactively acknowledge failures, and never ignore problems just to complete tasks.

# Task 2: Design and Analysis

**üìñ START: Read `docs/STATUS.json` to check current progress before proceeding.**

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 2",
  "completed": false
}
```

## üî¥ Document-First Approach
**Task 2 focuses on creating comprehensive design documents before any code generation.**

## Task 2.1: Data Analysis

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 2.1",
  "completed": false
}
```


**Process:**
1. **ANALYZE**: Follow the systematic approach in `agentspace/knowledge/generator/data-analysis.md` for each identified data element
2. **DOCUMENT**: Use the Analysis Documentation Template from `agentspace/knowledge/generator/data-analysis.md` to create your `docs/data-design.json`
3. **VERIFY**: Cross-check that ALL data from the detailed requirements has been included in your analysis

**‚úÖ END Task 2.1: Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 2.1",
  "completed": true
}
```

## Task 2.2: Computation Analysis

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 2.2",
  "completed": false
}
```
**üìñ PRIMARY GUIDE: `./agentspace/knowledge/generator/computation-analysis.md`**
**üìñ REFERENCE ONLY: `./agentspace/knowledge/generator/computation-implementation.md`**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: You MUST strictly follow the systematic process in `computation-analysis.md`!**

**üî¥ MANDATORY PROCESS:**
1. **FIRST**: Read and understand `computation-analysis.md` completely
2. **USE PREVIOUS OUTPUTS**: Base your analysis on:
   - `docs/data-design.json` (from Task 2.1)
   - `requirements/interactions-design.json`
3. **ANALYZE**: For EVERY entity and EVERY property, follow the step-by-step analysis process
4. **DOCUMENT**: Create `docs/computation-analysis.json` documenting your analysis for each entity/property
5. **REFERENCE**: Use `./agentspace/knowledge/generator/computation-implementation.md` as a reference for syntax and examples

**Key Steps from computation-analysis.md:**
- [ ] Create analysis document at `docs/computation-analysis.json`
- [ ] Analyze each entity systematically (creation source, update requirements, deletion strategy)
- [ ] Analyze each property individually (type, purpose, data source, update frequency)
- [ ] Analyze each relation's complete lifecycle (creation, updates, deletion)
- [ ] Select appropriate computation type based on decision trees
- [ ] Document reasoning for each computation decision
- [ ] Follow the relation decision algorithm EXACTLY for relations

**Remember**: The systematic analysis process ensures you select the RIGHT computation type for each use case. This analysis will guide your implementation in the next phase!

**‚úÖ END Task 2: Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 2",
  "completed": true,
  "completedItems": [
    "data-design.json created",
    "computation-analysis.json created"
  ]
}
```

**üõë STOP: Task 2 completed. Wait for user instructions before proceeding to Task 3.**
