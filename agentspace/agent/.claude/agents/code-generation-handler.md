# Task 3: Code Generation and Progressive Testing

**📖 START: Read `docs/STATUS.json` to check current progress before proceeding.**

**🔄 Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3",
  "completed": false
}
```

**🔄 PROGRESSIVE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

Task 3 follows a **progressive, test-driven approach**:
1. **Implement incrementally**: Start with entities/relations, then interactions, then computations one by one
2. **Type check immediately**: Run `npm run check` after each implementation step
3. **Test each computation**: Write and run tests for each computation before moving to the next
4. **Fix issues immediately**: Don't accumulate problems - fix them as soon as they appear
5. **Build confidence gradually**: Each passing test confirms your implementation is correct

This approach prevents the accumulation of errors and makes debugging much easier.

## Task 3.1: Code Generation and Implementation

**🔄 Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1",
  "completed": false
}
```
- Clear next steps

**Based on the analysis documents created in Tasks 2.1-2.3, now implement the actual code.**

### Task 3.1.1: 🔴 CRITICAL: Read Complete API Reference First

**🔄 Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.1",
  "completed": false
}
```
**Before generating ANY code, you MUST thoroughly read `./agentspace/knowledge/generator/api-reference.md`**

This document contains:
- Complete and accurate API syntax and parameters
- Common mistakes and correct usage patterns
- Type definitions and constraints
- Real working examples

**Important Guidelines:**
- ✅ Always refer to the API reference for correct syntax
- ✅ When tests fail, FIRST check the API reference for correct usage
- ✅ Follow the exact parameter names and types shown in the API reference
- ❌ Do NOT rely on memory or assumptions about API usage
- ❌ Do NOT guess parameter names or syntax

Common issues that can be avoided by reading the API reference:
- Missing required parameters (e.g., `attributeQuery` in storage operations)
- Wrong property usage (e.g., `symmetric` doesn't exist in Relation.create)
- Incorrect computation placement (e.g., Transform cannot be used in Property computation)
- Hardcoded relation names (always use `RelationInstance.name` when querying relations)

## 🔴 Recommended: Single File Approach
**To avoid complex circular references between files, it's recommended to generate all backend code in a single file:**

- ✅ Define all entities, relations, interactions, and computations in one file
- ✅ Example structure: `backend/index.ts` containing all definitions

**✅ END Task 3.1.1: Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.1",
  "completed": true
}
```

**📝 Commit changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Task 3.1.1 - Complete API reference study"
```

### Task 3.1.2: Entity and Relation Implementation

**🔄 Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.2",
  "completed": false
}
```
- Clear next steps

- [ ] Generate all entities based on `docs/data-design.json`. **DO NOT define any computations yet**. No `computed` or `computation` on properties
- [ ] Define entity properties with correct types
  - **🔴 CRITICAL: NO reference ID fields in entities!**
    - ❌ NEVER: `userId`, `postId`, `requestId`, `dormitoryId` as properties
    - ✅ Relations will handle all entity connections
  - Only primitive values and entity-specific data (name, status, timestamp, etc.)
  - **IMPORTANT: If a property will have `computed` or `computation`, do NOT set `defaultValue`**
    - The computation will provide the value, defaultValue would conflict
    - Either use defaultValue OR computation, never both
- [ ] Generate all relations with proper cardinality
  - Relations define how entities connect
  - Relations create the property names for accessing related entities
- [ ] Define relation properties
- [ ] **Type Check**: Run `npm run check` to ensure TypeScript compilation passes
  - Fix any type errors before proceeding
  - Do NOT continue until all type errors are resolved

**✅ END Task 3.1.2: Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.2",
  "completed": true
}
```

**📝 Commit changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Task 3.1.2 - Complete entity and relation implementation"
```

### Task 3.1.3: Interaction Implementation

**🔄 Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.3",
  "completed": false
}
```
- Clear next step


- [ ] Generate all interactions based on `docs/interaction-design.md`. **DO NOT define any conditions yet** - we will add permissions and business rules later in Task 3.2. No `condition` parameter in Interaction.create()
- [ ] Start with simple payload-only interactions (no conditions initially)
- [ ] Ensure all payloads match the documented fields
- [ ] **Type Check**: Run `npm run check` to ensure TypeScript compilation passes
  - Fix any type errors before proceeding
  - Do NOT continue until all type errors are resolved

**✅ END Task 3.1.3: Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.3",
  "completed": true
}
```

**📝 Commit changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Task 3.1.3 - Complete interaction implementation"
```

### Task 3.1.4: Progressive Computation Implementation with Testing

**🔄 Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.4",
  "completed": false
}
```
- Clear next step

**📖 MUST READ: `./agentspace/knowledge/generator/test-implementation.md`**


**🔴 CRITICAL: Use Progressive Implementation with Immediate Testing**

This section follows a **test-driven progressive approach** where each computation is implemented and tested individually before moving to the next one.

#### Task 3.1.4.1: Create Test File

**🔄 Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.4.1",
  "completed": false
}
```
- [ ] Copy contents from `tests/basic.template.test.ts` to create `tests/basic.test.ts`. **DO NOT add any test cases yet** - we will add them progressively as we implement each computation
- [ ] This will be your main test file for progressive implementation
- [ ] Import your backend definitions: `import { entities, relations, interactions } from '../backend'`

**✅ END Task 3.1.4.1: Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.4.1",
  "completed": true
}
```

**📝 Commit changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Task 3.1.4.1 - Create test file structure"
```

#### Task 3.1.4.2: Create Implementation Plan

**🔄 Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.4.2",
  "completed": false
}
```

**📋 Generate the Computation Implementation Plan:**

- [ ] Run the command: `npm run plan`
  - This command analyzes `docs/computation-analysis.json` and automatically generates the implementation plan
  - The plan will be created at `docs/computation-implementation-plan.json`
  - Computations are automatically ordered by dependencies (least to most dependent)

- [ ] **Verify the generated file:**
  - Check that `docs/computation-implementation-plan.json` exists
  - Open the file and confirm it contains:
    - Multiple phases organized by dependency complexity
    - Each computation with its decision, method, and dependencies
    - A logical progression from simple to complex computations

**🔴 CRITICAL: If the command fails or the file is not generated:**
1. Check that `docs/computation-analysis.json` exists and is valid JSON
2. If issues persist, stop and wait for user commands

**🛑 STOP: Computation implementation plan generated. Review `docs/computation-implementation-plan.json` and wait for user instructions before proceeding to Task 3.1.4.3.**

**✅ END Task 3.1.4.2: Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.4.2",
  "completed": true

{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.1.4.3",
  "completed": false,
  "completionCriteria": "All items in `docs/computation-implementation-plan.json` have `completed: true`"
}
```

**📌 NOTE: For Task 3.1.4.3, use the specialized sub-agent `computation-generation-handler`**

This task has its own dedicated sub-agent that handles the progressive implementation of computations one by one.

**🛑 STOP GATE: DO NOT proceed to Task 3.1.4.4 until ALL computations in `docs/computation-implementation-plan.json` are marked as complete with passing tests.**

**🔄 Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.2.0",
  "completed": false
}
```

**📋 Set up dedicated test file for permissions and business rules:**

- [ ] Copy contents from `tests/permission.template.test.ts` to create `tests/permission.test.ts`
  - This template is specifically designed for permission and business rule testing
  - **DO NOT add any test cases yet** - we will add them progressively as we implement each rule
- [ ] This will be your dedicated test file for all permission and business rule tests
- [ ] Import your backend definitions: `import { entities, relations, interactions } from '../backend'`
- [ ] Verify the file structure includes the 'Permission and Business Rules' describe group

**🔄 Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.2.1",
  "completed": false
}
```

**📋 Create the Permission and Business Rules Implementation Plan:**

### Task 3.2.3: Completion Checklist

**🔄 Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 3.2.3",
  "completed": false
}
```

- [ ] All permissions from `docs/interaction-design.md` are implemented
- [ ] All business rules from requirements are implemented
- [ ] Each rule has comprehensive test coverage (success and failure cases)
- [ ] All type checks pass (`npm run check`)
- [ ] All permission tests pass (`npm run test tests/permission.test.ts`)
- [ ] Error scenarios are properly documented

**Note on Error Messages:**
Since permissions and business rules are unified in the `conditions` API, the framework returns a generic error when conditions fail:
- The error type will be `'condition check failed'` for all condition failures
- You cannot distinguish between different types of failures in the error message
- Best practices:
  - Use descriptive Condition names (e.g., 'isAdmin', 'hasValidCapacity')
  - Document expected error scenarios for each Interaction
  - Test both permission failures and business rule violations separately
  - Consider logging more detailed information within the condition's content function for debugging
