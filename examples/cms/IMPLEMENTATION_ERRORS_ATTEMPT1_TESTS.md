# Test Execution Errors - Attempt 1

## Error Encountered

### Transform Computation Registration Error
- **Error**: `cannot find Computation handle for Transform`
- **Location**: Controller/Scheduler initialization
- **Root Cause**: Transform computations not properly registered with the scheduler
- **Impact**: Controller cannot be instantiated, all tests fail

## Analysis

The issue is that Transform computations defined within Entity/Property/Relation `computation` fields are not being recognized by the framework's computation system. This could be due to:

1. **API Change**: The framework may have changed how computations are registered
2. **Missing Registration**: Transform computations may need to be explicitly registered
3. **Incorrect Usage**: Transform may need to be used differently than documented

## Possible Solutions

1. **Check if Transform should be passed separately**: Maybe the framework expects Transform computations to be passed as a separate parameter to Controller
2. **Use different computation types**: Maybe Transform is not the right computation type for this use case
3. **Check framework examples**: Look at working examples to see correct usage pattern
4. **Simplify approach**: Remove complex Transform logic and use basic entity definitions first

## Update: Simplified Entities Work

✅ **Good News**: Controller now starts successfully with simplified entities (no Transform computation error)

❌ **New Issue**: Interactions execute but don't create entities
- Interaction events are logged to `_Interaction_` table
- No Style entities are created in response to interactions
- This indicates missing entity creation logic

## Root Cause

In interaqt framework, entities are created reactively through Transform computations that listen to InteractionEventEntity. Since I removed all Transform logic to fix the computation error, now nothing responds to interactions to create entities.

## Possible Solutions for Attempt 2

1. **Check if Transform should be passed separately to Controller**
2. **Find the correct way to register Transform computations**
3. **Look for alternative patterns for entity creation**
4. **Check if there's a different API for reactive entity creation**
