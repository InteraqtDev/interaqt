# Implementation Errors #02 - Computation Handle Error

## Error Summary
During test execution, encountered error: "cannot find Computation handle for Transform"

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue: Transform Computation Not Registered
**Error**: `cannot find Computation handle for Transform`
**Location**: Controller instantiation in test setup
**Cause**: The Transform computations defined in Entity properties are not being registered with the Controller properly

### Investigation
The error occurs when the Controller tries to set up the runtime and cannot find the Transform computation handlers. This suggests that:

1. Transform computations in Entity/Property definitions are not being extracted and registered
2. The Controller constructor signature may not match our usage
3. The computation registration process might be different than expected

### Analysis of Current Code
In our entities, we have Transform computations like:
```typescript
Property.create({
  name: 'updated_at',
  computation: Transform.create({
    record: InteractionEventEntity,
    callback: function(event) { ... }
  })
})
```

And in Entity itself:
```typescript
const Style = Entity.create({
  computation: Transform.create({
    record: InteractionEventEntity,
    callback: function(event) { ... }
  })
})
```

### Possible Root Causes
1. **Incorrect Controller Constructor Usage**: The Controller constructor may require computations to be passed explicitly
2. **Computation Extraction Issue**: The framework may not automatically extract computations from Entity/Property definitions
3. **Missing Computation Registration**: We may need to explicitly register all Transform computations

## Lesson Learned
The interaqt framework requires explicit computation registration rather than automatic extraction from Entity/Property definitions. This indicates a gap in understanding the proper Controller setup process.

## Next Steps
1. Research correct Controller constructor signature and computation registration process
2. Extract all Transform computations into a separate array
3. Pass computations explicitly to Controller constructor
4. Re-run tests to verify fix
