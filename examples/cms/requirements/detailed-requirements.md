# CMS Backend - Detailed Requirements Analysis

## Business Context
A content management system backend that allows product operations personnel to manage preset data through an online administrative interface.

## Core Business Entity Analysis

### Style Entity
The central entity representing style configurations with the following characteristics:

**Data Perspective:**
- **Primary Entity**: Style (core business object)
- **Identity**: UUID-based unique identification
- **Classification**: Type-based categorization (animation, surreal, etc.)
- **Content**: Label, slug, description for presentation
- **Media**: Thumbnail reference via S3 key
- **Status Management**: Draft → Published → Offline lifecycle
- **Ordering**: Priority-based sorting for frontend display
- **Audit Trail**: Created/updated timestamps

**Relationship Perspective:**
- **User-Style Relations**: Operations personnel who manage styles
- **Version-Style Relations**: Version management for rollback capabilities

## User Role Analysis

### Admin User
- **Permissions**: Full CRUD access to all styles
- **Operations**: Create, read, update, delete, publish, unpublish styles
- **Version Management**: Create versions, rollback to previous versions
- **Bulk Operations**: Mass update priorities for sorting

## Business Process Analysis

### Style Management Workflow
1. **Creation**: Admin creates new style in draft status
2. **Editing**: Iterative updates to style properties while in draft
3. **Publishing**: Transition from draft to published status
4. **Maintenance**: Updates to published styles, priority adjustments
5. **Archiving**: Moving styles to offline status (soft delete)

### Version Management Workflow
1. **Version Creation**: Snapshot current styles state
2. **Version Labeling**: Tag versions with descriptive names
3. **Rollback**: Restore styles to previous version state
4. **Version History**: Track all version changes

### Sorting Management
1. **Priority Assignment**: Set numeric priority values
2. **Bulk Reordering**: Update multiple style priorities
3. **Frontend Ordering**: Styles displayed by priority (ascending)

## Technical Requirements

### Data Integrity
- UUID generation for unique identification
- Slug uniqueness validation
- URL-safe slug format validation
- Automatic timestamp management

### Status Transitions
- Valid transitions: draft → published, published → offline, offline → published
- No direct draft → offline transitions

### Version Control
- Immutable version snapshots
- Version metadata (creation time, creator, description)
- Rollback capability preserving data integrity

### Sorting Mechanism
- Integer-based priority values
- Support for bulk priority updates
- Efficient reordering operations

## Performance Considerations

### Query Patterns
- List styles by status (active styles for frontend)
- Sort styles by priority
- Version history queries
- User activity tracking

### Scalability Requirements
- Support for hundreds of style records
- Efficient bulk operations
- Version history without performance impact

## Security Requirements

### Authentication
- Admin user authentication required for all operations
- Session management for admin access

### Authorization
- Role-based access control
- Admin-only access to all style operations
- Audit logging for all changes

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization for all text fields
- File upload validation for thumbnails
- Business rule validation (status transitions)

## Integration Requirements

### External Systems
- S3 integration for thumbnail storage
- Frontend API for published styles retrieval
- Admin interface API for management operations

### API Design Principles
- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- Batch operations support
- Consistent error handling
- Comprehensive response formatting

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Reliability
- Data consistency across operations
- Transactional integrity for bulk operations
- Robust error handling and recovery

### Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Documentation for all business rules
- Audit trail for troubleshooting

### Usability
- Intuitive API design
- Clear error messages
- Efficient bulk operations
- Responsive performance
