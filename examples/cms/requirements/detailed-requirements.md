# Style Management System - Detailed Requirements Analysis

## Business Domain Analysis

This is a content management system for Style objects, designed for product operations personnel to manage preset data through a backend interface.

### Data Perspective Analysis

#### Core Entity: Style
Based on the requirements, the Style entity has the following properties:

**Required Properties:**
- `id` (uuid, auto-generated): Unique identifier
- `label` (text, manual): Display name for frontend (e.g., "Manga")
- `slug` (text, manual): Unique, URL-safe identifier (e.g., "manga"), corresponds to legacy "value"
- `description` (text, manual): Style description
- `type` (varchar(32), manual): Style category (e.g., "animation", "surreal")
- `thumb_key` (text, manual): S3 storage address for thumbnail
- `priority` (int, manual): Frontend display priority/sorting order
- `status` (varchar(16), manual): Publication status (draft/published/offline)
- `created_at` (timestamptz, auto): Creation timestamp
- `updated_at` (timestamptz, auto): Last update timestamp

**Computed Properties:**
- Total count of styles in different statuses
- Version history tracking

#### Supporting Entities

**User Entity:**
- `id` (uuid): User identifier
- `username` (string): Username
- `role` (string): User role (admin, editor, viewer)
- `email` (string): Email address
- `created_at` (timestamptz): Account creation time
- `last_login_at` (timestamptz): Last login time

**Version Entity (for version management):**
- `id` (uuid): Version identifier
- `version_name` (string): Version name/number
- `description` (string): Version description
- `created_at` (timestamptz): Version creation time
- `published_at` (timestamptz): Version publication time
- `is_current` (boolean): Whether this is the current active version

### Interaction Perspective Analysis

#### Core Operations and Required Interactions

1. **Style Management Operations:**
   - CreateStyle: Create new style entry
   - UpdateStyle: Modify existing style
   - DeleteStyle: Remove style (soft delete)
   - PublishStyle: Change status to published
   - UnpublishStyle: Change status to offline
   - ReorderStyles: Update priority values for sorting

2. **Version Management Operations:**
   - CreateVersion: Create new version snapshot
   - PublishVersion: Make a version active
   - RollbackVersion: Revert to previous version
   - ViewVersionHistory: List all versions

3. **Query Operations:**
   - ListStyles: Get styles with filtering and sorting
   - GetStyle: Get single style details
   - SearchStyles: Search styles by label/description

#### Permission Requirements

**Role-based Access Control:**
- **Admin**: Full access to all operations
- **Editor**: Can create, update, and publish styles; cannot manage versions
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

**Data-level Permissions:**
- Users can only edit styles they created (unless admin)
- Only published styles are visible to frontend
- Draft styles are only visible to creators and admins

#### Business Process Analysis

**Style Lifecycle:**
1. Draft → (Publish) → Published
2. Published → (Unpublish) → Offline
3. Any Status → (Delete) → Deleted (soft delete)

**Version Management Process:**
1. Create working version from current published version
2. Make changes to styles in working version
3. Publish entire version (atomically updates all styles)
4. Option to rollback to previous version if issues found

## Technical Requirements

### State Management
- Style status state machine: draft → published → offline
- Version management for rollback capability
- Audit trail for all changes

### Performance Requirements
- Efficient sorting by priority
- Quick search functionality
- Optimized queries for frontend data serving

### Data Integrity
- Unique slug validation
- Referential integrity between styles and versions
- Automated timestamps

### API Requirements
- RESTful interface for frontend integration
- Real-time updates for collaborative editing
- Bulk operations support

## Gaps and Clarifications

The original requirements need clarification on:
1. **Version Management Scope**: Are versions per-style or system-wide?
2. **Rollback Granularity**: Individual style rollback or entire system rollback?
3. **Deletion Strategy**: Hard delete or soft delete preferred?
4. **Concurrent Editing**: How to handle multiple users editing simultaneously?

**Assumptions Made:**
- Version management is system-wide (snapshot of all styles)
- Soft delete strategy for data preservation
- Priority values are integers, lower numbers = higher priority
- Slug uniqueness is enforced across all styles regardless of status
