# Iteration 3 - Major Success with Remaining Issues

## Progress Summary
✅ **5 out of 7 tests now passing!** Major improvement from previous iterations.

## Success Analysis

### Fixed Issues
1. **Entity Creation**: Style entities are now created successfully via Transform
2. **Automatic Relations**: UserStyleRelation is created automatically when Style includes creator reference
3. **Status Management**: PublishStyle and UnpublishStyle work correctly with StateMachine
4. **Filtered Entities**: PublishedStyle entity works correctly with MatchExp.atom filterCondition
5. **Validation**: CreateStyle properly validates required fields and returns appropriate errors

### Working Test Cases
- ✅ TC001: Create Style successfully
- ✅ TC002: Validation errors for invalid data  
- ✅ TC004: Publish Style successfully
- ✅ TC005: Unpublish Style successfully
- ✅ TC011: List only published styles

## Remaining Issues

### Issue 1: Duplicate Slug Validation (TC014)
**Problem**: No validation prevents duplicate slugs
**Expected**: Second CreateStyle with same slug should return error
**Actual**: Second CreateStyle succeeds without error

**Analysis**: The framework doesn't automatically prevent duplicate values. Need to add validation logic.

**Solution Options**:
1. Add dataAttributive to CreateStyle interaction to check slug uniqueness
2. Add unique constraint in entity properties
3. Add validation in Transform callback

### Issue 2: Relation Query Error 
**Problem**: Error when querying UserStyle relation
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'sourceRecordName')
```

**Analysis**: The relation name might be auto-generated differently than expected. In the SQL logs, we can see the relation is stored as fields within the Style table rather than a separate relation table.

**Solution**: Check the actual relation name generated by the framework and use correct query.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **High**: Fix duplicate slug validation 
2. **Medium**: Fix relation query to use correct relation name
3. **Low**: Optimize tests and add more edge cases

## Framework Learning
- Relations are automatically created when entities reference each other
- MatchExp.atom() required for filterCondition in filtered entities  
- StateMachine needs defaultState parameter
- Transform computations work well for entity creation
- Validation needs to be explicitly implemented

## Status
- **Overall**: Major success - core functionality working
- **Completion**: ~70% of requirements implemented and tested
- **Quality**: Good - most business logic working correctly
