DOM states are not reactive, and we often need to:

- Listen to state changes through event callbacks.
- Transform data changes into DOM state changes through APIs.

axii provides reactive wrappers for commonly used DOM states, and users can also customize DOM state reactive wrappers using RxDOMState.
Existing wrappers include:
- RxDOMSize
- RxDOMRect
- RxDragPosition
- RxScrollPosition
