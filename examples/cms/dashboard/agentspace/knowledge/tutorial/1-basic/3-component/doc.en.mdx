Axii Component Features:
- Supports default value creation. In scenarios where reactivity is not needed, regular values can be passed in, and the framework will automatically convert them.
- Internal DOM elements or child components can be exposed through explicit naming, eliminating unnecessary encapsulation.

At this point, you're ready to happily use Axii!
