Axii provides the statemachine0 library to manage complex state transition logic. It is based on the concept of finite state machines, allowing for clear definition of states, events, and transition rules.

## Basic Usage

Create a state machine instance and define state transition rules:

```jsx
const transitions = [{
    name: 't1', from: 'initial', event: 'process', to: 'processing'
}, {
    name: 't2', from: 'processing', event: 'done', to: 'done'
}, {
    name: 't3', from: 'done', event: 'reset', to: 'initial'
}]

const stateMachine = new Machine('initial', transitions)
```

## Custom States

You can create custom state classes for each state to implement specific behaviors:

```jsx
stateMachine.addState(new CommonState('initial'))
stateMachine.addState(new ProcessingState())
stateMachine.addState(new CommonState('done'))
```

## Middleware

You can add middleware to intercept the state transition process, implementing features like logging, permission checking, etc.:

```jsx
stateMachine.use(log)
stateMachine.use(checkCredential)
```

## Triggering State Transitions

Trigger state transitions by dispatching events:

```jsx
// Create a transition event
const processEvent = createTransitionEvent('process')

// Trigger the state transition
stateMachine.transition(processEvent)
```

The statemachine0 library makes complex state management simple and maintainable, particularly suitable for applications with clearly defined state flows.
