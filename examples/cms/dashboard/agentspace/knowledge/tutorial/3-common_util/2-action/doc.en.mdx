Axii provides the action0 library to manage the state and flow of asynchronous operations. It helps you handle single async operations, serial operations, and parallel operations, while providing complete state management.

## Single Operations

Use the `SingleAction` class to manage a single asynchronous operation:

```jsx
const action = new SingleAction(async () => {
    await wait(1000)
    return 'success'
})

// Start the operation
action.start()

// Get the operation status
const status = action.status()
```

## Serial Operations

Use the `SerialActions` class to manage multiple asynchronous operations that need to be executed in sequence:

```jsx
const actions = new SerialActions([
    async () => { await wait(1000); return 'step 1' },
    async () => { await wait(1000); return 'step 2' },
    async () => { await wait(1000); return 'step 3' }
])

// Start all operations
actions.start()
```

## Parallel Operations

Use the `ParallelActions` class to manage multiple asynchronous operations that can be executed simultaneously:

```jsx
const actions = new ParallelActions([
    async () => { await wait(1000); return 'task 1' },
    async () => { await wait(2000); return 'task 2' },
    async () => { await wait(3000); return 'task 3' }
])

// Start all operations
actions.start()
```

The action0 library makes state management for asynchronous operations simple and intuitive, particularly suitable for handling complex asynchronous flows.
