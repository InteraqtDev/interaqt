# Claude Working Guide for interaqt Framework - Test-Case Driven Development

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for Claude when working with the interaqt framework. It combines the working standards with detailed test-case driven development workflow to ensure high-quality, consistent outputs that align with the framework's principles.

## Core Principle: Test-Case Driven Development

When using LLM to generate interaqt applications, you must follow **test-case driven** development workflow. This ensures:
1. Generated code has no hallucinations - every feature has clear acceptance criteria
2. All interactions and computations are covered by tests
3. **Perfect frontend-backend alignment: frontend is an exact mapping of backend, no more, no less**
4. All frontend features derive from backend test cases, with no standalone frontend functionality

## I. Pre-Execution Knowledge Loading (MANDATORY)

### üî¥ CRITICAL RULE: Knowledge Base Loading

**Before executing ANY task related to interaqt**, you MUST read and internalize the complete knowledge base located in `agentspace/knowledge/` as your foundation prompt. This is not optional.

### Required Reading Order

1. **Core Philosophy** (MUST READ FIRST):
   ```
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/00-mindset-shift.md
   ```
   - Understand the fundamental shift from "manipulating data" to "declaring data essence"
   - Internalize the reactive programming paradigm

2. **Framework Concepts** (READ SEQUENTIALLY):
   ```
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/01-core-concepts.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/02-define-entities-properties.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/03-entity-relations.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/04-reactive-computations.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/05-interactions.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/06-attributive-permissions.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/07-activities.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/08-filtered-entities.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/09-async-computations.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/10-global-dictionaries.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/11-data-querying.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/12-testing.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/13-api-reference.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/14-entity-crud-patterns.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/15-frontend-page-design-guide.md
   agentspace/knowledge/usage/16-performance-optimization.md
   ```

3. **Test Cases Learning**:
   ```
   ../../tests/runtime/
   ```
   - Learn comprehensive testing patterns from existing test cases
   - Understand how to test entities, relations, interactions, and computations
   - Study integration testing approaches and edge case handling


### ‚ö†Ô∏è Knowledge Loading Validation

After reading the knowledge base, you MUST demonstrate understanding by:
1. Acknowledging the reactive programming paradigm
2. Confirming understanding of Entity, Relation, Interaction, and Computation concepts
3. Showing awareness of the test-driven development approach

## II. Backend Generation Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Test Case Design

#### 1.1 Deep Requirements Analysis
- Analyze user business requirements, supplement vague or missing details
- Analyze from data perspective: identify all entities, properties, relationships
- Analyze from interaction perspective: list all user operations, permission requirements, business processes
- Create `requirements/detailed-requirements.md` document

#### 1.2 Test Case Documentation (CRITICAL)
Create `requirements/test-cases.md` document with complete test cases:

```markdown
## TC001: Create Article
- Preconditions: User logged in with publishing permission
- Input Data: title="Tech Sharing", content="Content...", tags=["frontend", "React"]
- Expected Results:
  1. Create new article record
  2. Article status is draft
  3. Creation time is current time
  4. Author linked to current user
  5. User's article count automatically +1
- Post Validation: Article appears in user's article list

## TC002: Like Article
- Preconditions: Article exists and user hasn't liked it
- Input Data: postId="post123"
- Expected Results:
  1. Create like relationship record
  2. Article's like count automatically +1
  3. User's like list includes this article
- Exception Scenario: Duplicate like should fail
```

#### 1.3 Interaction Matrix
Create `requirements/interaction-matrix.md` to ensure:
- Every user role has corresponding Interactions for all operations
- Every Interaction has clear permission controls
- Every Interaction has corresponding test cases

### Phase 2: Code Generation & Implementation

#### 2.1 Project Structure
```
generated-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements/          # Requirements and test case docs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ detailed-requirements.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-cases.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ interaction-matrix.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/               # Backend source code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ relations/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interactions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ computations/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts          # DO NOT instantiate Controller here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                 # Test code
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ interactions/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ computations/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ e2e/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/             # Frontend code
```

**Important: Backend Code Organization**
- The `backend/index.ts` file should ONLY export entities, relations, computations, interactions arrays
- DO NOT instantiate Controller in `backend/index.ts`
- Controller should be instantiated in test files or server entry point
- Example of correct `backend/index.ts`:
```typescript
// backend/index.ts
export * from './entities'
export * from './relations'
export * from './computations'
export * from './interactions'

// Optionally export arrays for convenience
export const entities = [User, Post, Comment]
export const relations = [UserPostRelation, PostCommentRelation]
export const computations = [PostCount, CommentCount]
export const interactions = [CreatePost, UpdatePost, DeletePost]
```

#### 2.2 Implementation Order (STRICTLY FOLLOW)
1. First implement all Entity and Property
2. Then implement all Relation
3. Next implement all Computation (Count, Transform, etc.)
4. Finally implement all Interaction and Activity
5. Write corresponding tests immediately after completing each module
6. **TypeScript Type Check**: After generating source code, ensure there are NO TypeScript type errors
7. **Test Type Check**: After generating test code, ensure test files also have NO TypeScript type errors

### Phase 3: Test-Driven Validation (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

#### 3.1 Test Framework Setup
- Use vitest as testing framework
- Configure test database using interaqt's PGLiteDB (NOT raw PGLite)
- Use framework APIs directly in tests (no need for test utilities)
- Import statement should use correct package name: `import { ... } from 'interaqt'`

**Correct test database setup example:**
```typescript
import { describe, test, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest'
import { Controller, MonoSystem, KlassByName, PGLiteDB } from 'interaqt'
import { entities, relations, interactions, activities } from '../backend'

describe('Test Suite', () => {
  let system: MonoSystem
  let controller: Controller
  
  beforeEach(async () => {
    // ‚úÖ Correct: Use PGLiteDB from interaqt package
    system = new MonoSystem(new PGLiteDB())
    system.conceptClass = KlassByName
    
    controller = new Controller(
      system,
      entities,
      relations,
      activities,
      interactions,
      [],
      []
    )
    
    await controller.setup(true)
  })
  
  // Your tests here...
})
```

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Wrong: Don't use raw PGLite
import { PGlite } from '@electric-sql/pglite'
const db = new PGlite()

// ‚ùå Wrong: Don't import from wrong package
import { PGLite } from 'pglite'

// ‚úÖ Correct: Always use PGLiteDB from interaqt
import { PGLiteDB } from 'interaqt'
const system = new MonoSystem(new PGLiteDB())
```

#### 3.2 Test Coverage Requirements
- All Interactions must have at least one success case and one failure case
- All properties with computedData must verify auto-calculation logic
- All permission controls must have positive and negative tests

#### 3.3 Test Execution (STRICTLY FOLLOW)
After writing each test module, you MUST:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit           # Check TypeScript types (must pass with no errors)
npm test                    # Run all tests (must pass with no errors)
npm test -- --coverage      # View test coverage (must reach 100%)
```
- If tests fail, fix the implementation immediately
- Do not proceed to next module until current tests pass
- Report test results after each execution

### Phase 4: Documentation Generation

Create `docs/` directory with:
- `architecture.md`: Architecture design from requirements to implementation
- `api-reference.md`: API documentation for all Interactions
- `data-model.md`: Entity relationship diagrams and data dictionary
- `computation-logic.md`: Logic explanation for all reactive computations

### Phase 5: Backend Quality Assurance Checklist

- [ ] All requirements have corresponding test cases
- [ ] All test cases have corresponding test code
- [ ] **No TypeScript type errors in source code** (run `npx tsc --noEmit`)
- [ ] **No TypeScript type errors in test code**
- [ ] All test cases passed (Critical Step)
- [ ] Test coverage reaches 100% (Critical Step)
- [ ] No fictional non-existent Entity or Interaction
- [ ] All reactive computations trigger correctly

## III. Frontend Generation Process

### Phase 1: Frontend Project Initialization
```bash
cd generated-project
npx create-axii-app frontend
cd frontend
```

### Phase 2: Frontend Test Case Design

**Core Principle: Frontend test cases must completely derive from backend test cases**
- Frontend cannot have functionality that doesn't exist in backend
- Every backend feature must have corresponding interface in frontend
- Frontend test cases are UI manifestations of backend test cases

#### 2.1 Test Case Mapping Analysis
Create `frontend/requirements/backend-frontend-mapping.md`:
```markdown
## Backend to Frontend Test Case Mapping

### TC001: Create Article ‚Üí UTC001: Article Creation Interface
- Backend Interaction: CreatePost
- Frontend Page: /posts/new
- UI Elements: title input, content editor, tag selector, submit button
- Data Validation: consistent with backend

### TC002: Like Article ‚Üí UTC002: Like Button
- Backend Interaction: LikePost
- Frontend Location: article detail page, article list item
- UI Elements: like icon, like count display
- State Management: liked/unliked state
```

#### 2.2 Page Planning
Create `frontend/requirements/page-plan.md`:
- Plan pages based on backend Interactions
- Clearly list backend APIs called by each page
- Ensure no fictional features or missing features

#### 2.3 UI Test Cases
Create `frontend/requirements/ui-test-cases.md`:
```markdown
## UTC001: Article Creation Interface (corresponds to TC001)

- Steps:
  1. Fill title: "Tech Sharing"
  2. Input content: "Content..."
  3. Select tags: "frontend", "React"
  4. Click "Save Draft" button
- Expected Results:
  1. Call CreatePost API
  2. Show loading state
  3. Navigate to article detail page after success
  4. Article status shows "Draft"
- Validation Points: Exactly correspond to TC001 expected results

## UTC002: Like Functionality (corresponds to TC002)
- Preconditions: Viewing unliked article
- Page: /posts/:id
- Steps:
  1. Click like button
- Expected Results:
  1. Call LikePost API
  2. Like count +1
  3. Button state changes to liked
- Exception Test: Repeated clicks should show "Already liked" prompt
```

#### 2.4 Feature Completeness Check
Create `frontend/requirements/completeness-check.md`:
```markdown
## Backend Feature Coverage Checklist

### Interactions
- [ ] CreatePost ‚Üí New article page
- [ ] UpdatePost ‚Üí Edit article page
