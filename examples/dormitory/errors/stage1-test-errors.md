# Stage 1: Test Execution Errors

## Error Details

When running Stage 1 tests, encountered the following errors:

1. **System terminate error**: `TypeError: system.terminate is not a function`
2. **MatchExpression error**: `match data is not a BoolExpression instance, you passed: [object Object]`

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: System Terminate Method
- Used `system.terminate()` which doesn't exist on MonoSystem
- Should use proper cleanup method or remove if not needed

### Issue 2: Delete Method Usage
- Used `await system.storage.delete('EntityName', {})` with empty object
- Empty object is not a valid MatchExpression
- Should use proper MatchExpression or omit condition to delete all records

## Solutions Applied

1. Remove or fix terminate method call
2. Fix delete method to use proper MatchExpression syntax for "delete all" operations
3. Ensure all test cleanup uses correct API patterns

## Status
- **Stage**: Stage 1 - Testing Phase  
- **Priority**: High (blocking test execution)
- **Next Steps**: Fix test setup and cleanup, then re-run tests
