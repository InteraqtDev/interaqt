# Iteration 3: Computation Default Values Setup Error

## Error Summary
Tests fail with "SchedulerError: Failed to setup computation default values" during Controller.setup().

## Root Cause Analysis
The error occurs in the Scheduler.setupDefaultValues() phase, suggesting there's an issue with computation definitions in the backend entities.

## Investigation Details
1. **TypeScript Compilation**: Passes successfully with `npm run check`
2. **Database Schema Creation**: Tables are being created properly (visible in console output)
3. **Error Location**: Controller.setup() → Scheduler.setup() → setupDefaultValues()

## Potential Issues
Based on the error pattern, possible causes include:
1. **Circular computation dependencies**: Computations that reference each other in a loop
2. **Invalid computation configurations**: Missing required parameters or incorrect types
3. **Forward reference issues**: State machines trying to access interactions before they're fully initialized
4. **Default value computation failures**: Computations that fail when calculating initial values

## Investigation Steps Needed
1. Review all computations in entities to find circular dependencies
2. Check state machine configurations and state transfers
3. Verify all computation types are used correctly (Transform, StateMachine, Count, etc.)
4. Check if any computations reference undefined entities or interactions

## Current Status
- Backend implementation completed but has runtime computation setup errors
- Need to systematically debug each entity's computations
- Tests cannot proceed until computation setup is fixed

## Next Steps
1. Identify specific computation causing the setup failure
2. Fix the computation configuration
3. Rerun tests to verify the fix
4. Continue with Stage 1 test implementation
