# Round 7: Final Solution Approach

## Summary of Issues Encountered

1. **Integer overflow**: Timestamp values too large for PostgreSQL INTEGER type
2. **Entity naming mismatch**: Framework expects specific entity names for relations
3. **Complex state management**: StateMachine causing initialization errors
4. **Updates in computations**: Cannot update entities inside Transform callbacks

## Final Approach for Stage 1

To get Stage 1 tests passing, we need to:

1. **Remove all timestamps** - Store as strings instead
2. **Simplify relations** - No computations in relations
3. **Use action effects** - Handle all state updates in interaction effects
4. **Minimal computations** - Only use Transform for entity creation

## Key Learnings

1. The framework has specific expectations about entity relationships
2. Computations should be pure transformations, not side-effects
3. Stage 1 should focus on basic functionality without complex state management
4. Action effects are the proper place for updating entity states

## Success Criteria

For Stage 1 completion:
- All 10 core business logic tests pass
- No permissions or business rules enforced
- Basic CRUD operations work correctly
- Relationships are properly established
