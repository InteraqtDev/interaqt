# Round 5: Final Status

## Summary

After 5 iterations, we've made significant progress but haven't achieved full test coverage.

## Test Results: 4/9 Passing (44%)

### ✅ Passing Tests
1. **TC001: Create Dormitory** - Successfully creates dormitory with beds
2. **TC002: Assign Dormitory Head** - User role changes to dormHead  
3. **TC005: Submit Kick-Out Application** - Application is created with pending status
4. **TC009: Remove Dormitory Head** - User role reverts to student

### ❌ Failing Tests
1. **TC003: Assign User to Bed** - Transform computation error for UserBedRelation
2. **TC004: Record Point Deduction** - Point deduction created but recordedBy not retrieved properly
3. **TC006: Approve Kick-Out Application** - Application status not updating properly
4. **TC007: Reject Kick-Out Application** - Application status not updating properly
5. **TC008: Remove User from Bed** - StateMachine cannot find bed by occupant relation

## Key Achievements
- Successfully implemented entity and relation structures
- Basic interactions working (create, assign roles)
- StateMachine computations working for simple state transitions
- Transform computations working for entity creation

## Remaining Challenges
1. **Complex State Transitions**: The removal interactions (RemoveUserFromBed) have issues with computeTarget
2. **Relation-based Queries**: The framework has trouble finding records through relation properties
3. **Nested State Updates**: ProcessKickOutApplication needs to update both application status and user status

## Lessons Learned
1. **computeTarget is Critical**: StateMachine transfers need properly defined computeTarget functions
2. **Property Names Matter**: Long property names can exceed database column limits
3. **Test Data Isolation**: Each test needs to be self-contained with its own data setup
4. **Framework Patterns**: Understanding Transform vs StateMachine usage is crucial

## Recommendation
The system demonstrates core functionality but needs refinement for complex state management and relation-based operations. Consider:
1. Simplifying the computeTarget logic for removal operations
2. Using direct entity queries instead of relation-based lookups
3. Breaking complex interactions into simpler steps
