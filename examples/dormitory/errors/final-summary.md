# Final Summary - Stage 1 Implementation

## Results
- **2 out of 10 tests passing**
- Maximum iterations reached (7 rounds)
- Partial success achieved

## Tests Status
- ✅ TC002: Create Dormitory with Maximum Capacity
- ✅ TC010: Create Violation Rule  
- ❌ TC001: Create Dormitory (occupancy count issue)
- ❌ TC003: Assign User to Bed (status update issue)
- ❌ TC004: Assign Dorm Head (role update issue)
- ❌ TC005: Record Violation (entity lookup issue)
- ❌ TC006: Request Kickout (relation lookup issue)
- ❌ TC007-TC009: Dependent on earlier fixes

## Key Issues Encountered

### 1. Integer Overflow (Fixed)
- PostgreSQL INTEGER type couldn't handle JavaScript timestamps
- Solution: Changed to string type for timestamps

### 2. BoolExpression Error (Fixed)
- find() method expected undefined instead of empty object
- Solution: Changed find('Entity', {}) to find('Entity')

### 3. Entity Property Retrieval (Fixed)
- Properties weren't automatically fetched
- Solution: Added attributeQuery parameter to specify fields

### 4. StateMachine Complexity (Partially Fixed)
- StateMachine computations caused initialization errors
- Solution: Removed StateMachine, used simple defaultValues

### 5. Relation Entity Naming (Not Fully Resolved)
- Framework expected specific entity naming for relations
- Attempted various approaches but couldn't fully resolve

### 6. Action Effects (Not Working)
- Action effects didn't execute as expected
- Framework might not support effects in the way we implemented

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple**: Complex state management should be avoided in Stage 1
2. **Framework Limitations**: The framework has specific expectations about how entities and relations work
3. **Computation Restrictions**: Computations should be pure transformations, not side effects
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Some framework features aren't well documented
5. **Incremental Approach**: Should have started with the simplest possible implementation

## Recommendations for Future Implementation

1. Study working examples more carefully before implementation
2. Start with minimal entities and relations, add complexity gradually
3. Avoid StateMachine until basic functionality works
4. Use Transform computations only for entity creation
5. Handle state updates through proper framework mechanisms
6. Test each component in isolation before integration

## What Worked
- Basic entity creation (Dormitory, ViolationRule)
- Simple Transform computations for entity creation
- Default values for properties
- Basic relation definitions (when not using computations)

## What Didn't Work
- Complex state management with StateMachine
- Action effects for updating entity states
- Relation computations with side effects
- Computed properties dependent on relations
- Complex lookup operations in Transform callbacks
