# Stage 1 Test Progress Summary

## Current Status
- **Phase 2.4 (Backend Implementation)**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Phase 2.5.1 (TC001 Test)**: ✅ COMPLETED  
- **Phase 2.5.2 (Remaining Tests)**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS

## Successful Test Cases

### ✅ TC001: Create Dormitory - PASSED
**Verified functionality:**
- Admin user creation works
- CreateDormitory interaction executes successfully
- Dormitory entity created with correct properties:
  - name: '1号楼101' ✓
  - capacity: 4 ✓ 
  - occupiedCount: 0 ✓
  - availableCount: 4 ✓
- Transform computation works: 4 beds automatically created ✓
- Bed entities created with correct properties:
  - bedNumber: 1,2,3,4 ✓
  - status: 'available' ✓
- DormitoryBedRelation established correctly ✓
- Storage queries (system.storage.find) work ✓

## Known Issues

### ❌ TC003-TC010: DefaultValue Function Error
**Error**: `column.defaultValue is not a function`
**Root Cause**: Unknown - occurs during table creation on subsequent tests
**Status**: Under investigation

**Key Observations:**
- TC001 creates tables successfully with same entity definitions
- Error only occurs on subsequent test runs 
- Entity definitions appear correct (defaultValue functions are properly defined)
- Likely related to system cleanup/recreation between tests

## Next Steps
1. Investigate defaultValue error - possibly related to:
   - System cleanup between tests
   - Entity definition reuse 
   - Property computation conflicts
2. Fix remaining TC003-TC010 tests iteratively
3. Proceed to Phase 2.6 (permissions) after core logic is stable

## Architecture Validation
✅ **Core interaqt framework integration working**
✅ **Entity-Relation-Interaction pattern working**
✅ **Transform computations working**
✅ **StateMachine computations setup correctly** 
✅ **Storage layer functional**
✅ **Test infrastructure functional**
