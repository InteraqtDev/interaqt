# Error Round 1 - Initial Implementation Issues

## Date: 2025-07-18
## Round: 1/7

## Summary
Initial implementation completed basic entities, relations, interactions, and tests. However, there are several computation-related errors preventing tests from passing.

## Errors Encountered

### 1. BedSpace Creation Transform Error
**Location**: `backend/entities.ts` - DormitoryBedSpaceRelation computation
**Error Type**: ComputationError / ComputationDataDepError
**Details**: 
- Trying to use Transform in Relation to automatically create bed spaces when dormitory is created
- `dataDeps.dormitories` is undefined during execution
- Relation Transform with dataDeps is complex and causing failures

**Root Cause**: 
- Misunderstanding of when dataDeps are available in Transform computations
- Trying to access newly created dormitory data through dataDeps which may not be immediately available
- Complex timing issue between entity creation and relation computation

### 2. Missing Required Field Validation
**Location**: Test case TC010
**Expected**: Should return error for missing required fields
**Actual**: Interaction succeeds without validation
**Cause**: No validation logic implemented yet - this is expected until permissions phase

### 3. Test Dependency Issues  
**Location**: Tests TC001, TC002, TC003, TC009
**Error**: Various undefined property access
**Details**: Tests expecting dormitory and bed space data that fails to be created due to computation errors

## Current Status

### Working Components
- ✅ Basic Entity definitions (User, Dormitory, BedSpace, Assignment, Violation, KickoutRequest)
- ✅ Basic Relation definitions
- ✅ Basic Interaction definitions (all CRUD operations)
- ✅ Simple Entity Transform computations (User, Dormitory, Assignment, Violation, KickoutRequest creation)
- ✅ Test framework setup
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Working test cases: TC004, TC005, TC006, TC007, TC008, TC010

### Failed Components
- ❌ BedSpace automatic creation when dormitory is created
- ❌ Dormitory creation tests (TC001, TC002) 
- ❌ Assignment-related tests (TC003, TC009) that depend on BedSpace creation
- ❌ Complex Transform computations with dataDeps

### Tests Status
- **Passing**: 6/10 tests
- **Failing**: 4/10 tests
- **Failing Rate**: 40%

## Identified Solutions for Next Round

### Solution 1: Simplify BedSpace Creation
- Remove complex Relation Transform for bed space creation
- Use side effects or simpler approach
- Create bed spaces through a separate interaction if needed

### Solution 2: Alternative Approaches
1. **Option A**: Create bed spaces in a side effect after dormitory creation
2. **Option B**: Create a separate "SetupDormitory" interaction that creates both dormitory and bed spaces
3. **Option C**: Use simpler Transform without dataDeps complexity

### Solution 3: Fix Test Dependencies
- Update tests to handle scenarios where bed spaces might not be automatically created
- Add proper error checking in tests
- Separate bed space creation testing from dormitory creation testing

## Next Round Plan

1. **Remove problematic Transform computation** from DormitoryBedSpaceRelation
2. **Implement simpler bed space creation** mechanism
3. **Fix test dependencies** and error handling
4. **Re-run tests** to verify improvements
5. **Document any remaining issues** for subsequent rounds

## Code Changes Needed

1. Remove Transform computation from `DormitoryBedSpaceRelation`
2. Simplify bed space creation approach
3. Update failing tests to handle the new approach
4. Ensure all basic CRUD operations work before moving to permission phase

## Lessons Learned

1. **Complex Transform computations with dataDeps** are error-prone and should be avoided initially
2. **Automatic creation of related entities** is complex and might require different patterns
3. **Test-first approach** revealed computation issues early
4. **Framework has full CRUD capabilities** - need to implement them correctly

## Next Steps

Focus on getting basic functionality working before adding complex reactive behaviors. The core business logic (user management, violation reporting, kickout requests) is working correctly.
