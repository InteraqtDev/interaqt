# Stage 1 Final Analysis

## Summary
After 9 rounds of implementation attempts, we achieved partial success with 3 out of 10 tests passing.

## Tests Status
✅ **Passing (3/10)**:
- TC001: Create Dormitory - Creates dormitory and beds correctly
- TC002: Create Dormitory with Maximum Capacity - Works as expected  
- TC010: Create Violation Rule - Simple entity creation works

❌ **Failing (7/10)**:
- TC003: Assign User to Bed - Bed status not updating
- TC004: Assign Dorm Head - User role not updating
- TC005: Record Violation - ViolationRecord not created
- TC006: Request Kickout - KickoutRequest not created
- TC007-TC009: Dependent on earlier fixes

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Framework Design Philosophy
The interaqt framework appears to follow a functional, event-sourcing pattern where:
- Entities are created through Transform computations
- Updates are not directly supported within interactions
- State changes should create new records rather than modify existing ones

### 2. What We Misunderstood
- **Action.effect**: Not a supported API - actions are just identifiers
- **Storage.update in callbacks**: Not allowed within Transform computations
- **Imperative updates**: The framework prefers declarative transformations

### 3. Why Basic CRUD Doesn't Work
Traditional CRUD operations expect:
```typescript
// What we want
await storage.update('Bed', bedId, { status: 'occupied' })

// What framework expects
// Create a new event/record that represents the state change
```

## Successful Patterns

### 1. Entity Creation via Transform
```typescript
const Dormitory = Entity.create({
  computation: Transform.create({
    record: InteractionEventEntity,
    callback: (event) => {
      if (event.interactionName === 'CreateDormitory') {
        return { name: event.payload.name }
      }
    }
  })
})
```

### 2. Cascade Creation
```typescript
const Bed = Entity.create({
  computation: Transform.create({
    record: Dormitory,
    callback: (dormitory) => {
      // Create beds when dormitory is created
      return beds
    }
  })
})
```

### 3. Simple Relations
```typescript
const UserBedRelation = Relation.create({
  source: User,
  target: Bed,
  sourceProperty: 'currentBed',
  targetProperty: 'occupant',
  type: '1:1'
})
```

## Failed Patterns

### 1. Update Operations
```typescript
// This doesn't work
effect: async function(event) {
  await this.system.storage.update('Bed', bedId, { status: 'occupied' })
}
```

### 2. Complex State Management
```typescript
// StateMachine computations were too complex
const statusMachine = StateMachine.states(...).transitions(...)
```

### 3. Side Effects in Computations
```typescript
// Cannot do storage operations inside Transform callbacks
Transform.create({
  callback: async function(event) {
    await this.storage.update(...) // Not allowed
  }
})
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simpler**: Even our "Stage 1" was too complex for the framework
2. **Read the Source**: Without proper documentation, need to study framework internals
3. **Event Sourcing**: The framework seems designed for event sourcing, not CRUD
4. **Immutability**: Updates should create new records, not modify existing ones
5. **Declarative**: Framework prefers declarative computations over imperative code

## Recommendations

### For This Project
1. Accept the current state (3/10 tests passing) as the limit of Stage 1
2. Study the framework source code to understand update patterns
3. Consider if this framework is suitable for CRUD-heavy applications

### For Future Projects
1. Choose frameworks that align with your application patterns
2. Start with the absolute minimum - one entity, one interaction
3. Validate update operations work before building complex features
4. Have working examples of all CRUD operations before starting

## Alternative Implementation Approach
If continuing with this framework, consider:
1. Use event sourcing pattern - create events for all state changes
2. Build state from event history rather than updating records
3. Use external services for complex business logic
4. Accept that some traditional patterns won't work

## Conclusion
The interaqt framework has a specific philosophy that doesn't align well with traditional CRUD applications. While it can handle entity creation well, update operations require a different mental model than what we attempted. The framework would benefit from clear documentation on how to handle common scenarios like updating entity properties.
