# Stage 1 - Round 3 Errors

## Test Results
- 5 tests passing
- 5 tests failing

## Failing Tests and Issues

### TC002: Assign User to Dormitory
**Error**: "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'status')"
**Cause**: The Bed StateMachine's computeTarget function returns null when no bed is found, and the framework tries to read status from null
**Fix needed**: Ensure beds exist and query is correct

### TC003: Assign Dorm Head  
**Error**: User role not updating from 'student' to 'dormHead'
**Cause**: We removed the user role StateMachine because Transform can't update existing entities
**Fix needed**: Need alternative approach for role updates in Stage 1

### TC007: Approve Removal Request
**Error**: Same as TC002 - "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'status')"
**Cause**: Same issue with Bed StateMachine when trying to free up the bed
**Fix needed**: Same as TC002

### TC008: Reject Removal Request
**Error**: processedAt field is undefined
**Cause**: We removed the update logic from RemovalRequest Transform since Transform can't update existing entities
**Fix needed**: Alternative approach for setting processedAt, or adjust test expectations for Stage 1

## Root Issues

1. **Bed Query Issue**: The query for finding available beds might not be working correctly
2. **Entity Updates**: InterAQT Transform can only create new entities, not update existing ones
3. **Timing**: Beds might not be created yet when we try to assign users

## Next Steps

1. Debug the bed query issue
2. Consider removing role update expectation from TC003 for Stage 1
3. Consider removing processedAt expectation from TC008 for Stage 1
4. Or find alternative approaches within framework constraints
