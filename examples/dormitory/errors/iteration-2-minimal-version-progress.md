# Iteration 2: Minimal Version Progress

## Success Summary
The minimal version has significantly improved the situation:
- **5 tests passing** vs 0 tests passing in iteration 1  
- **2 tests failing** vs 10 tests failing in iteration 1
- **Controller setup successful** - the main setup error is resolved

## Working Features
1. ✅ **Basic Setup**: Controller and system initialization works
2. ✅ **Dormitory Creation**: CreateDormitory interaction works correctly
3. ✅ **Score Rule Creation**: CreateScoreRule interaction works correctly  
4. ✅ **Score Deduction**: DeductUserScore interaction works correctly
5. ✅ **Kick Request**: RequestKickUser interaction works correctly

## Remaining Issues

### Issue 1: Property Default Values Not Applied
**Test**: "Can create users"
**Error**: `expected undefined to be 100` for `totalScore` property

**Analysis**: When creating users via `system.storage.create()`, the default values from Property definitions are not being applied. The user object lacks the `totalScore` and `status` default values.

**Root Cause**: Default values in Property definitions might only apply during entity computation/transform, not during direct storage operations.

### Issue 2: Relation Query Error  
**Test**: "Can assign user to dormitory"
**Error**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'sourceRecordName')`

**Analysis**: This error occurs when calling `findOneRelationByName()`. The relation exists and was created successfully (based on SQL logs), but querying it fails.

**Root Cause**: There might be an issue with how the relation metadata is stored or accessed in the framework.

## Key Insights

### What Worked
1. **Simplified Computations**: Removing complex StateMachine and Custom computations eliminated the setup errors
2. **Transform-Based Entity Creation**: Entity Transform computations work correctly for interaction-triggered creation
3. **Basic Relation Creation**: Relations are created successfully through Transform computations

### What Needs Investigation
1. **Property Default Value Application**: Need to understand when/how default values are applied
2. **Relation Query Infrastructure**: Need to understand the relation querying mechanism
3. **Entity Property Access**: Need to verify how to properly access computed vs direct properties

## Fix Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Property Default Values
1. Investigate if default values require specific framework mechanisms
2. Test if computed properties with simple functions work better
3. Consider using Transform computations for user creation instead of direct storage

### Phase 2: Fix Relation Queries  
1. Simplify the relation query test to isolate the issue
2. Investigate alternative ways to verify relation creation
3. Check if the issue is with the specific relation or all relations

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Testing
1. Add more edge case tests for successful scenarios
2. Verify data consistency across all working interactions
3. Test interaction chains (create dormitory → assign user → assign dorm head)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix the property default value issue
2. **Short-term**: Resolve relation query issue  
3. **Medium-term**: Add comprehensive Stage 1 test coverage
4. **Long-term**: Implement Stage 2 with permissions and business rules

## Success Metrics
- Target: 7/7 tests passing for minimal Stage 1 functionality
- Current: 5/7 tests passing (71% success rate)
- Improvement: From 0% to 71% success rate
