Axii provides a lightweight routing solution called router0, which supports nested routes, route parameters, and route redirects.

## Basic Usage

Create a router instance using the Router class and define route configurations:

```jsx
const router = new Router([{
    path: '/music',
    handler: Music,
}, {
    path: '/sport',
    handler: Sport,
}, {
    path: '/',
    redirect: '/music',
}], createMemoryHistory())
```

## Route Listening

You can listen for route changes and store the path in reactive data:

```jsx
const path = atom(router.history.location.pathname)
router.history.listen((event) => {
    path(event.location.pathname)
})
```

## Nested Routes

Create sub-routes using the `router.derive()` method and pass them to child components via Context:

```jsx
const SubRouter = router.derive(router.path())
return <ContextProvider contextType={RouterContext} value={SubRouter}>
    <Content />
</ContextProvider>
```

router0 is designed to be simple yet powerful, capable of meeting the routing needs of most single-page applications.
