The reactive data structures in Axii include the following types:

- atom: Atomic data that is treated as a whole.
- RxList/RxMap/RxSet: Reactive collection data structures that emit signals when the collection changes, but changes within the collection objects are not deeply reactive.
- RxTime: A special reactive data structure for handling time.

We can pass an atom to any DOM attribute, and when the atom's value changes, the DOM attribute will automatically update.
We can also map an RxList to a DOM array, and when the RxList's value changes, the DOM array will automatically update.

Even if you're using RxMap/RxSet, they have corresponding toList methods that can convert them to RxList, allowing you to map them to DOM arrays.

For more dynamic requirements, you can directly pass a function to represent the DOM structure that needs to be generated.
