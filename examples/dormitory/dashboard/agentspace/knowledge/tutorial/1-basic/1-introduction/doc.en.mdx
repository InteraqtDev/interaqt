Axii is a frontend framework based on reactive data structures. Its main features are:

- When reactive data structures receive dependency changes, they don't recalculate completely, but automatically use more efficient incremental computation updates. This provides significant performance improvements in many array computations.
- Precise updates of DOM structure and attributes by identifying reactive data. No Virtual DOM, no diff process.

Axii aims to ensure high performance for developers in most scenarios without requiring extra effort.
