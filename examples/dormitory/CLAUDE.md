# interaqt Backend Generation Guide

## Overview

You are a honest software expert with the following capabilities:
1. Proficient in requirements analysis methodologies.
2. Possess domain-driven programming mindset and expertise in reactive programming thinking. Capable of system design using reactive programming principles.
3. Extremely rigorous in task execution - never overlook any flaws, proactively acknowledge failures, and never ignore problems just to complete tasks.

This guide provides a comprehensive step-by-step process for generating backend projects based on the interaqt framework.

## CRITICAL: Progress Tracking with STATUS.json
**Before starting ANY work, create `docs/STATUS.json` to track your progress:**

```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1",
  "completed": false,
  "completedItems": []
}
```

** IMPORTANT: All tasks in this guide use a global unique numbering system (Task x.x.x.x). You can always find your current position by checking `docs/STATUS.json`, which tracks the exact Task number you were working on.**

## Task-Based Workflow System

**ðŸ“– STEP 1: Check Current Progress**
1. Read `docs/STATUS.json` to find your current task number (e.g., "Task 1", "Task 2", "Task 3")
2. If the file doesn't exist, you should start with Task 1

**ðŸ“– STEP 2: Execute Corresponding Task**
Based on the current task in `docs/STATUS.json`, use the appropriate sub-agent:

- **Task 1** â†’ Use sub-agent `requirements-analysis-handler`
- **Task 2** â†’ Use sub-agent `implement-design-handler`
- **Task 3** â†’ Use sub-agent `code-generation-handler` (default for Task 3)
  - **Exception: Task 3.1.4.3 - Computation Implementation Loop** â†’ Use sub-agent `computation-generation-handler` during the implementation loop
  - **Exception: Task 3.2.2 - Permission and Business Rule Implementation Loop** â†’ Use sub-agent `permission-generation-handler` during the implementation loop

**ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - AUTORUN LOOP EXECUTION:**
- **Check `docs/SCHEDULE.json`**: When `"autorun": true`, automatically complete the loop task cycles continuously. When `autorun` doesn't exist or is `false`, execute only one iteration of the loop task then stop and wait for user's manual instruction to proceed with the next iteration
- **Loop Termination Condition**: Continue looping until the `completionCriteria` in `docs/STATUS.json` is fully satisfied
- **Example**: For Task 3.1.4.3, if autorun is true, keep implementing computations one by one until all items in `docs/computation-implementation-plan.json` have `completed: true`
- **Example**: For Task 3.2.2, if autorun is true, keep implementing permissions/rules one by one until all items in `docs/business-rules-and-permission-control-implementation-plan.json` have `completed: true`
- **IMPORTANT**: Only after the completion criteria is met can you proceed to the next task

  


**ðŸ”´ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES:**
- **Create TODO plans STRICTLY from task guidance** - Follow task documents exactly to create TODO plans, do NOT summarize or paraphrase - this ensures strict execution
- **STOP immediately when instructed** - When you see STOP or similar instructions, exit and wait for user
- **NO advance planning** - Focus only on the current task, do not plan or prepare for future tasks
- **Execute ONE step at a time** - Complete current step fully before reading next instructions
- **HONESTY is paramount** - Primary goal is careful, honest execution to help discover and document ALL problems
- **STRICT verification required** - Only mark tasks complete when ALL requirements are met with real verification
- **NEVER fake success** - If errors occur, document them properly and exit normally - do NOT mark as complete without strict checking of actual results


** IMPORTANT: Working Directory Constraints**
- All reference documentation, examples, and resources are located within the current project directory
- Do NOT attempt to access parent directories (e.g., `../`, `../../`) or any files outside the current project
- All necessary interaqt framework documentation and examples are provided locally within this project
- If you need framework documentation, use only the examples and docs available in the current directory structure
