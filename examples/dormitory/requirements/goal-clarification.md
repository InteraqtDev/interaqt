# Goal Clarification and Completion

## Original Goals as Provided

The user provided the following requirements for a dormitory management system (translated from Chinese):

1. There should be a global dormitory administrator who can designate users as dormitory leaders
2. Administrator can create dormitories, each dormitory has 4-6 beds
3. Administrator can assign users to dormitories, each user can only be assigned to one bed in one dormitory
4. Need some common user behavior scoring rules, when points are deducted to a certain level, dormitory leaders can apply to remove a user
5. When administrator approves the removal request, the user is removed

## Analysis of Original Goals

### Clarity Assessment
- **Specific enough**: Yes, the goals provide clear functional requirements
- **Measurable outcomes**: Goals specify concrete actions and constraints (4-6 beds, one user per bed, scoring system)
- **Role definitions**: Clear distinction between administrator and dormitory leader roles

### Completeness Assessment
- **Basic functionality**: Covered (user management, room assignment, scoring)
- **User roles**: Partially covered (administrator, dormitory leader, regular user)
- **Workflow processes**: Basic workflow described (assignment, scoring, removal)

### Scope Assessment
- **Appropriate scope**: Yes, focused on core dormitory management without over-engineering
- **Domain boundaries**: Clear focus on residential management and behavioral monitoring

## Identified Gaps and Ambiguities

1. **User Authentication**: No mention of how users log in or are authenticated
2. **Data Validation**: No specification of validation rules for dormitory creation or user assignments
3. **Basic Reporting**: No mention of basic administrative reports or dashboards
4. **Error Handling**: No specification of what happens when operations fail
5. **Scoring System Details**: Vague description of "common user behavior scoring rules"
6. **User Registration**: No mention of how new users are added to the system

## Added Common Completions with Justification

### For Management Systems (Universal Expectations)
1. **User authentication and authorization** - Essential for multi-user system with different roles
2. **Basic CRUD operations** - Implied but not explicitly mentioned for core entities
3. **Data validation and error handling** - Critical for data integrity in assignment system
4. **Basic reporting/dashboard capabilities** - Common expectation for administrative systems

### For Workflow Systems (Common Expectations)
1. **Status tracking and transitions** - For removal request workflow
2. **Audit trails for compliance** - Important for tracking dormitory assignments and removals
3. **Notification mechanisms** - For informing users of assignments, removals, or score changes

## Final Refined Goal Set for Analysis

### Primary Goals (Original + Essential Completions)
1. **User Management**: Manage system users with authentication and role-based access (Administrator, Dormitory Leader, Regular User)
2. **Dormitory Management**: Create and manage dormitories with 4-6 beds each
3. **Assignment Management**: Assign users to dormitory beds with one-user-per-bed constraint
4. **Behavioral Scoring**: Implement scoring system for user behavior with deduction rules
5. **Removal Workflow**: Enable dormitory leaders to request user removal and administrators to approve/reject
6. **Basic Reporting**: Provide administrative dashboards for system overview
7. **Data Integrity**: Ensure validation and error handling for all operations
8. **Audit Trail**: Track all significant actions for compliance and monitoring

### Stakeholders Identified
- **Global Administrator**: System-wide management and approval authority
- **Dormitory Leader**: Dormitory-specific management and removal request authority
- **Regular User**: Assigned dormitory residents subject to scoring and potential removal
- **System**: Automated scoring and validation processes

### Success Criteria
- Users can be successfully assigned to dormitory beds without conflicts
- Scoring system accurately tracks and applies behavioral rules
- Removal workflow functions properly with proper approval mechanisms
- System maintains data integrity and provides audit capabilities
- Administrative reporting provides necessary oversight information
