# Test Cases Based on Interactions

## Test Suite Organization
Test cases are organized in phases according to implementation priority:
1. **Core Business Logic Tests** (implement first)
2. **Permission Tests** (implement after core logic works)
3. **Business Rule Tests** (implement after core logic works)

## Phase 1: Core Business Logic Tests

### TC001: Create Dormitory (via CreateDormitory Interaction)
- **Interaction:** AI001 - CreateDormitory
- **Preconditions:** User logged in as Administrator
- **Input Data:** name="Building A Dorm 1", totalBeds=5
- **Expected Results:**
  1. Create new dormitory record with specified name
  2. Create 5 bed records linked to dormitory
  3. All beds initially unoccupied (isOccupied = false)
  4. Dormitory creation timestamp set to current time
  5. leaderId initially null (no leader assigned)

  1. Interaction returns validation error
  2. Error indicates name required and beds must be 4-6
  3. No dormitory record created
  4. No bed records created
- **Note:** Do NOT test this with storage.create - it bypasses validation!
