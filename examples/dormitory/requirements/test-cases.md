# Dormitory Management System - Test Cases

## Edge Cases and Error Scenarios

### EC001: Capacity Validation
- Test dormitory creation with capacity 0, 1, 10 (all should fail)
- Only 4-6 capacity should succeed

### EC002: Concurrent Assignment Protection
- Two admins try to assign different users to same bed simultaneously
- Only one should succeed

### EC003: Score Boundary Testing
- User with score 5 receives -10 violation
- Score should become 0, not negative

### EC004: Dormitory Leader Limits
- User assigned as leader to multiple dormitories
- Should fail - one leader per dormitory, one dormitory per leader

### EC005: Self-Violation Prevention
- Leader tries to report violation against themselves
- Should be prevented by business logic

## Test Data Setup Requirements

### Users
- admin1: System administrator
- leader1: Dorm leader for Building A
- leader2: Dorm leader for Building B  
- resident1, resident2, resident3: Regular residents

### Dormitories
- dorm1: Building A Room 101 (capacity 6, leader: leader1)
- dorm2: Building B Room 201 (capacity 4, leader: leader2)

### Initial State
- All users start with score 100
- Some beds occupied, some available
- No pending kickout requests
