# Project Implementation Status

## Current Phase
Phase 3: Code Generation and Progressive Testing

## Current Step
3.1.4 Step 3: Progressive Implementation Loop

## Completed Items
- [x] STATUS.md created
- [x] API Reference read completed
- [x] Phase 1 & 2 documents verified
- [x] All entities implemented (User, Dormitory, Bed, ViolationRecord, EvictionRequest)
- [x] All relations implemented (7 relations)
- [x] All interactions implemented (9 interactions)
- [x] Type checking passed
- [x] Created tests/basic.test.ts
- [x] Created docs/computation-implementation-plan.md
- [x] First computation implemented: User.isEligibleForEviction (with passing tests)

## Notes
- **DO NOT proceed without reading the above reference document completely**
- **MUST Read `docs/computation-implementation-plan.md` to see which computations are completed and what's next.**
- Successfully implemented first computation from Phase 1
- Progressive implementation approach is working correctly
- 4/4 tests passing for basic functionality

## Next Steps
- Continue with remaining computations in implementation plan
- Follow progressive approach: implement → type check → test → document
- Phase 1 complete, moving to Phase 2: Entity-Level Transform Computations
