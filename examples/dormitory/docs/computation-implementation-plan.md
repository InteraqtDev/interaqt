  - Status: ✅ COMPLETED - Tests passing

- [x] **EvictionRequest.status**
  - Decision: StateMachine on Property.computation
  - Method: Transitions from 'pending' to 'approved' or 'rejected'
  - Dependencies: ReviewEvictionRequest interaction
  - Status: ❌ ISSUE - Framework incremental computation error
  - Notes: See docs/errors/statemachine-evictionrequest-properties-issue.md

- [x] **EvictionRequest.decidedAt**
  - Decision: StateMachine on Property.computation
  - Method: Sets timestamp when status changes from 'pending'
  - Dependencies: ReviewEvictionRequest interaction

## Phase 5: Complex Data-Dependent Computations
*Computations that calculate values based on related data*

- [ ] **User.points**
  - Decision: Custom on Property.computation

  - Dependencies: UserViolationRelation, ViolationRecord.points

- [ ] **Dormitory.occupancy**
  - Decision: Count on Property.computation
  - Method: Counts beds with status='occupied'
  - Dependencies: DormitoryBedRelation, Bed.status

- [ ] **Dormitory.availableBeds**
  - Decision: computed function on Property

  - Dependencies: capacity property, occupancy computation

- [ ] **Dormitory.occupancyRate**
  - Decision: computed function on Property
  - Method: Calculates (occupancy / capacity) × 100
  - Dependencies: occupancy computation, capacity property

## Notes
- Start implementation from Phase 1 and proceed sequentially
- Complete ALL computations in a phase before moving to the next
- Run tests after each computation implementation
- Document any blockers or issues in `docs/errors/`
