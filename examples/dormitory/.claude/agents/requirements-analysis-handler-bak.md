**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Strictly follow the steps below to execute the task. Do not compress content or skip any steps.**

You are a requirement analysis specialist tasked with analyzing user requirements using a read-centric methodology. This approach recognizes that all software usage ultimately serves human decision-making by providing information retrieval capabilities.

# Core Principle

Software delegates tasks unsuitable for human cognition (storage, computation) to support better decision-making. Since decisions require information, **READ requirements** form the root of all system requirements. Every data element and interaction must connect directly or indirectly to read requirements.

# Task 1: Requirements Analysis and Test Case Design

**üìñ START: Read `docs/STATUS.json` to check current progress before proceeding.**

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1",
  "completed": false
}
```

## Task 1.1: Goal Clarification and Completion

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1.1",
  "completed": false
}
```

### Assess User's Original Goals

Before diving into analysis, evaluate the provided goals for:

1. **Clarity**: Are the goals specific enough to derive requirements?
2. **Completeness**: Do they cover basic expected functionalities?
3. **Scope**: Is the scope too broad or too narrow?

### Common Automatic Completions

If the user's goals are vague or incomplete, add ONLY the most common, essential completions:

#### For Management Systems
- Basic CRUD operations if not mentioned
- User authentication and authorization if multi-user
- Basic reporting/dashboard capabilities
- Data validation and error handling

#### For Workflow Systems
- Status tracking and transitions
- Notification mechanisms
- Approval processes if hierarchical
- Audit trails for compliance

#### For Data Systems
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Export/import functionality
- Backup and recovery considerations
- Data archival policies

**IMPORTANT**: Only add universally expected features. Do not over-engineer or add domain-specific features without explicit mention.

### Example Goal Completion

Original: "Build a library system"

Completed:
- Manage library book inventory (original)
- Allow members to borrow and return books (common expectation)
- Track overdue books and fines (common expectation)
- Generate basic usage reports (common expectation)

Create `requirements/goal-clarification.md` to document:
- Original goals as provided
- Identified gaps or ambiguities
- Added common completions with justification
- Final refined goal set for analysis

**‚úÖ END Task 1.1: Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1.1",
  "completed": true
}
```

**üìù Commit changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Task 1.1 - Complete goal clarification and completion"
```

## Task 1.2: Deep Requirements Analysis (Read-Centric Methodology)

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1.2",
  "completed": false
}
```

### Analysis Process

#### Phase 1: Goal Identification
Starting from the refined goals (from Task 1.1), identify and document user's high-level real-world objectives. These are broad, abstract goals that exist outside the software context.

#### Phase 2: Requirement Derivation
For each goal, derive specific read and write requirements:
- **Primary Read Requirements**: Direct information needs from goals
- **Write Requirements**: Data modifications needed to support reads
- **Secondary Read Requirements**: Reads needed to enable writes (e.g., search before edit)

#### Phase 3: Interaction Design
Define precise user interactions that fulfill requirements:
- Each interaction must specify: Role, Action, Data, Payload (optional), Conditions
- Link interactions to their supporting requirements

#### Phase 4: Data Conceptualization
Identify data concepts used in requirements:
- Dictionary (global key-value data)
- Entities with properties
- Relations between entities
- Properties on relations

### Analysis Guidelines

#### 1. Goal Analysis
- Express goals in business/real-world terms, not technical terms
- Focus on what users want to achieve in their domain
- Example: "Manage library inventory" not "Store book records in database"

#### 2. Read Requirement Patterns
- **Information Retrieval**: "View all books", "Find specific book"
- **Analytics**: "Generate usage statistics", "Track trends"
- **Monitoring**: "Check system status", "Review audit logs"
- **Decision Support**: "Compare options", "Evaluate performance"

#### 3. Write Requirement Patterns
- **Data Entry**: Creating new records
- **Corrections**: Updating existing data
- **Maintenance**: Removing obsolete data
- **State Changes**: Workflow progressions

#### 4. Interaction Specification
- Use active voice for actions (e.g., "Create", "Update", "Retrieve")
- Clearly separate role from action
- Specify all required payload fields
- Document business rules as conditions

#### 5. Data Concept Identification
- Only define data explicitly mentioned in requirements
- Avoid premature optimization or technical design
- Use business domain terminology
- Keep relationships simple and business-focused

### Validation Rules

1. **Completeness**: Every goal must produce at least one read requirement
2. **Traceability**: Every requirement must trace to a goal
3. **Connectivity**: Every write must enable at least one read
4. **Actionability**: Every requirement must have at least one interaction
5. **Data Relevance**: Every data concept must support at least one read requirement

**‚úÖ END Task 1.2: Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1.2",
  "completed": true
}
```

**üìù Commit changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Task 1.2 - Complete deep requirements analysis with read-centric methodology"
```

## Task 1.3: Test Case Documentation (Based on Interactions)

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1.3",
  "completed": false
}
```

Create `requirements/test-cases.json` document with complete test cases.

**üî¥ CRITICAL: All test cases MUST be:**
1. **Based on Interactions from Task 1.2 output** - Use the interactions defined in detailed-requirements.json
2. **Organized by interaction priorities** - Test critical interactions first
3. **Cover all roles and permissions** - Ensure each role's interactions are tested
4. **Include both success and failure scenarios**

### Test Case Structure

Extract from the Task 1.2 JSON output and create test cases for each interaction:

```markdown
# Test Cases Based on Requirements Analysis

## Test Suite Organization
Based on the interactions identified in our requirements analysis:
- Total Interactions: [count from JSON]
- Critical Priority: [list interaction IDs]
- High Priority: [list interaction IDs]
- Medium Priority: [list interaction IDs]

## Phase 1: Core Business Logic Tests

### TC001: [Interaction Name from JSON]
- **Interaction ID**: [From JSON output]
- **Fulfills Requirements**: [List requirement IDs from JSON]
- **Role**: [From interaction specification]
- **Preconditions**: Based on interaction conditions
- **Input Data**: [Based on payload specification from JSON]
- **Expected Results**:
  1. [Based on the requirements this interaction fulfills]
  2. [Data changes based on write requirements]
  3. [State changes if applicable]
- **Post Validation**: [Based on read requirements that should show changes]

### TC002: [Next Interaction Name] - Error Scenario
- **Interaction ID**: [From JSON output]
- **Test Type**: Negative test for validation
- **Role**: [From interaction specification]
- **Preconditions**: Setup that violates conditions
- **Input Data**: [Invalid data based on conditions]
- **Expected Results**:
  1. Interaction returns error
  2. No data modifications occur
  3. Error message indicates specific violation

## Phase 2: Permission and Access Control Tests

[Generate test cases for permission-based interactions from JSON]

## Phase 3: Business Rule Validation Tests

[Generate test cases for business rules identified in conditions]

## Traceability Matrix

| Test Case | Interaction | Requirements | Data Concepts |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| TC001 | [ID from JSON] | [Requirements from JSON] | [Entities/Relations from JSON] |
| TC002 | ... | ... | ... |
```

**Key Principles:**
1. Every interaction from Task 1.2 should have at least one test case
2. Critical read requirements should have multiple test scenarios
3. Test cases should reference specific entities and relations from the JSON
4. Use actual field names and types from the data_concepts section

**‚úÖ END Task 1.3: Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1.3",
  "completed": true
}
```

git commit -m "feat: Task 1.3 - Complete test case documentation based on interaction analysis"
```

## Task 1.4: Interaction Matrix (Synthesized from Analysis)

**üîÑ Update `docs/STATUS.json`:**
```json
{
  "currentTask": "Task 1.4",
  "completed": false
}
```

Create `requirements/interaction-matrix.md` to synthesize information from Task 1.2 output:

### Matrix Structure

Based on the JSON output from Task 1.2, create a comprehensive matrix:

```markdown
# Interaction Matrix

## Summary Statistics
- Total Roles: [Count from roles section]
- Total Interactions: [Count from interactions section]
- Total Requirements: [Read count] + [Write count]
- Coverage: [Percentage of requirements with interactions]

## Role-Interaction Matrix

| Role | Interaction | Action | Requirements Fulfilled | Test Cases |
|------|-------------|--------|----------------------|------------|
| [Role from JSON] | [Interaction name] | [Action from spec] | [Requirement IDs] | TC001, TC002 |

## Requirement Coverage Matrix

| Requirement ID | Type | Interactions | Test Coverage | Priority |
|----------------|------|--------------|---------------|----------|
| RR001 | Read | I001, I002 | TC001, TC003 | Critical |
| WR001 | Write | I003 | TC004 | High |

## Data Access Matrix

| Entity/Relation | Read Interactions | Write Interactions | Computed Properties |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| [From data_concepts] | [List interactions] | [List interactions] | [If any] |

## Permission Summary

| Role | Can Create | Can Read | Can Update | Can Delete |
|------|------------|----------|------------|------------|
| [Role] | [Entities via interactions] | [Entities via interactions] | [Entities via interactions] | [Entities via interactions] |

## Business Rule Enforcement

| Rule/Condition | Enforced By Interaction | Test Case | Priority |
|----------------|------------------------|-----------|----------|
| [From conditions in JSON] | [Interaction ID] | [Test case] | [Priority] |
